<h2>Sum of each voxel's neighbors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For each voxel in a 3D logical or numeric array, sum the values of the six
neighboring voxels.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sum_neighbors_vol(arr, pad = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>arr</code></td>
<td>
<p>The 3D array.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pad</code></td>
<td>
<p>In order to compute the sum, the array is temporarily padded along
each edge with the value of <code>pad</code>. <code>0</code> (default) will mean that
edge voxels reflect the sum of 3-5 neighbors whereas non-edge voxels reflect
the sum of 6 neighbors. An alternative is to use a value of <code>NA</code> so
that edge voxels are <code>NA</code>-valued because they did not have a complete
set of six neighbors. Perhaps another option is to use <code>mean(arr)</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Diagonal voxels are not considered adjacent, i.e. the voxel at (0,0,0) is not
adjacent to the voxels at (1,1,0) or (1,1,1), although it is adjacent to
(1,0,0).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An array with the same dimensions as <code>arr</code>. Each voxel value
will be the sum across the immediate neighbors. If <code>arr</code> was a logical
array, this value will be between 0 and 6.
