<h2>fbar: Flux Balance Analysis in R with a tidy data approach</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>fbar is a simple, easy to use Flux Balance Analysis package with a tidy data approach. 
Just <code>data_frames</code> and the occasional <code>list</code>, no new classes to learn. 
The focus is on simplicity and speed. 
Models are expected as a flat table, and results can be simply appended to the table. 
This makes this package very suitable for use in pipelines with pre- and post- processing of models and results, so that it works well as a backbone for customized methods. 
Loading, parsing and evaluating a model takes around 0.1s, which, together with the straightforward data structures used, makes this library very suitable for large parameter sweeps.
