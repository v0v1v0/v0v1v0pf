Print Method for "frag.studies" Objects
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prints information about the fragility of multiple individual studies with binary outcomes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'frag.studies'
print(x, ...)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>"frag.studies"</code> produced by the function <code>frag.studies</code>.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The output consists of two parts: 1) the information about the number of studies, the pre-specified significance level, null value(s) (if the odds ratio, relative risk, and/or risk difference are used), the method(s) used to produce p-value(s), and the alternative hypothesis; and 2) the information about the fragility of the multiple studies, including the median, range (from minimum to maximum), and interquartile range (IQR, from the first quartile to the third quartile) of fragility index and those of fragility quotient based on each method considered. The second part about the fragility presents the information grouped by the direction of significance change (significance altered to non-significance and non-significance altered to significance) as well as the overall (ungrouped) information. If both groups have no event status modifications, the second part will not be printed because the fragility needs to be assessed based on certain event status modifications.
