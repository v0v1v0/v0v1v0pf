<h2>
High-precision values for some common constants, in character strings. 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are provided for use when playing around with some of the functions in this package, e.g., <code>bestFrac</code> or <code>cfrac</code> 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These represent, in order, "e" (natural log base), the golden ratio (1+sqrt(5))/2 aka "phi", "pi", and the square root of 2 as generated via <code>rmpfr</code> with 10 000 binary bits of precision.  There are many websites which can provide upwards of a million decimal digits for these constants for those who are interested.
