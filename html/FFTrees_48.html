<h2>Sonar data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The file contains patterns of sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder or bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock at various angles and under various conditions.
The transmitted sonar signal is a frequency-modulated chirp, rising in frequency.

<p><em>Criterion</em>: Did a sonar signal bounce off a metal cylinder (or a rock)?
</p>
<p>Values: <code>TRUE</code> (metal cylinder) vs. <code>FALSE</code> (rock) (53.37% vs.\ 46.63%).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We made the following enhancements to the original data for improved usability:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The binary factor <em>criterion</em> variable with exclusive "m" and "r" values was converted to a logical <code>TRUE/FALSE</code> vector.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Other than that, the data remains consistent with the original dataset.
