<h2>SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with FIA state, unit, county codes and names</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Polygon feature class with state and county boundaries defined by Census
Bureau, including Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes. The
FIA Survey Unit code and name attributes (UNITCD, UNITNM) were appended to
dataset, with joining columns of STATECD and COUNTYCD.

FIA Research Station name RSCD - FIA Research Station code STATECD - FIPS
state code STATENM - FIPS state name STATEAB - FIPS state abbreviation
UNITCD - FIA survey unit code UNITNM - FIA survey unit name COUNTYCD - FIPS
county code COUNTYNM - FIPS county name
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Derived from cb_2018_us_county_5m.  STATEFP was converted to numeric and
named STATECD COUNTYFP was converted to numeric and named COUNTYCD Lookup
table for FIA Research Station (REF_RESEARCH_STATION) was downloaded from
FIA DataMart on 20191105 (FIADB_1.6.1.00) and joined by STATECD. A lookup
table for UNITCD was created from plot data using unique STATECD, COUNTYCD,
UNITCD and joined to table.
