<h2>Fetch Player Stats</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>fetch_player_stats</code> returns the Individual Player Statistics for AFL games. Internally, it calls
a corresponding <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠fetch_player_stats_*⁠</code> function that depends on the source given.
By default the source used will be the official AFL website.
</p>
<p><code>fetch_player_stats_footywire()</code>, <code>fetch_player_stats_afltables()</code>, <code>fetch_player_stats_fryzigg()</code>
can be called directly and return data from AFL website, AFL Tables and
Squiggle, respectively.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fetch_player_stats(
  season = NULL,
  round_number = NULL,
  comp = "AFLM",
  source = "AFL",
  ...
)

fetch_player_stats_afl(season = NULL, round_number = NULL, comp = "AFLM")

fetch_player_stats_afltables(
  season = NULL,
  round_number = NULL,
  rescrape = FALSE,
  rescrape_start_season = NULL
)

fetch_player_stats_fryzigg(season = NULL, round_number = NULL, comp = "AFLM")

fetch_player_stats_footywire(
  season = NULL,
  round_number = NULL,
  check_existing = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>season</code></td>
<td>
<p>Season in YYYY format, defaults to NULL which returns the year
corresponding the <code>Sys.Date()</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>round_number</code></td>
<td>
<p>Round number, defaults to NULL which returns latest round</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comp</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of "AFLM" (default), "AFLW", "VFL", "VFLW", "WAFL", "U18B" or "U18G." Not all data sources will have non-AFL data</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>source</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of "AFL" (default), "footywire", "fryzigg", "afltables", "squiggle"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional parameters passed onto various functions depending on source.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rescrape</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, defaults to FALSE. Determines if we should re-scrape data for a given season. By default, we return cached data which is much faster. Re-scraping is slow but sometimes needed if historical data has changed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rescrape_start_season</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric, if <code>rescrape = TRUE</code>, which season should we start scraping from. Defaults to minimum value of season</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>check_existing</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, should we check existing data. This will likely be removed in future version as it takes a long time to re-scrape data</p>
</td>
</tr>

# Return data for whole season from footywire
fetch_player_stats(source = "footywire")

# This is equivalent to
fetch_player_stats_footywire()

# Currently there is no AFLW data and will return a warning
fetch_player_stats(2020, comp = "AFLW", source = "footywire")

# Different sources
fetch_player_stats(2015, round = 5, source = "footywire")
fetch_player_stats(2015, round = 5, source = "fryzigg")

# Directly call functions for each source
fetch_player_stats_afltables(2020)
fetch_fixture_fryzigg(2020)
fetch_player_stats_footywire(2020)

## End(Not run)
