<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The class <code>manifold</code> is virtual; other manifold classes inherit from this class.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A <code>manifold</code> object is characterised by a character variable <code>type</code>, which contains a description of the manifold, and a variable <code>measure</code> of type <code>measure</code>. A typical measure is the Euclidean distance.
</p>
<p><code>FRK</code> supports five manifolds; the real line (in one dimension), instantiated by using <code>real_line()</code>; the 2D plane, instantiated by using <code>plane()</code>; the 2D-sphere surface S2, instantiated by using <code>sphere()</code>; the R2 space-time manifold, instantiated by using <code>STplane()</code>, and the S2 space-time manifold, instantiated by using <code>STsphere()</code>. User-specific manifolds can also be specified, however helper functions that are manifold specific, such as <code>auto_BAUs</code> and <code>auto_basis</code>, only work with the pre-configured manifolds. Importantly, one can change the distance function used on the manifold to synthesise anisotropy or heterogeneity. See the vignette for one such example.
