<h2>Summarizes a netCDF file handle</h2>

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'ncdf'
summary(object,...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
 
<p>The "handle" returned by the <code>read.ncdf</code> function from the
ncdf package.  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p> Other arguments to pass to this function. Currently, no 
other arguments are used. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is out of place in fields but was included because often large
geophysical data sets are in netCDF format and the ncdf R package is also 
needed. To date the summary capability in the ncdf package is limited and 
this function is used to supplement it use. The function is also a a 
useful device to see how the ncdf object is structured.
