<h2>1981 French Presidential Election</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Elections for the French presidency proceed in two rounds. In 1981, there
were 10 candidates in the first round. The top two candidates then went on
to the second round, which was won by Francois Mitterand over Valery
Giscard-d'Estaing. The losers in the first round can gain political favors
by urging their supporters to vote for one of the two fina Since
voting is private, we cannot know how these votes were transferred, we might
hope to infer from the published vote totals how this might have happened.
Data is given for vote totals in every fourth department of France:
