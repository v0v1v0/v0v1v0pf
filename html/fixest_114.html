<h2>R2s of <code>fixest</code> models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reports different R2s for <code>fixest</code> estimations (e.g. <code>feglm</code> or <code>feols</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">r2(x, type = "all", full_names = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>fixest</code> object, e.g. obtained with function <code>feglm</code> or <code>feols</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector representing the R2 to compute. The R2 codes are of the form:
"wapr2" with letters "w" (within), "a" (adjusted) and "p" (pseudo) possibly missing.
E.g. to get the regular R2: use <code>type = "r2"</code>, the within adjusted R2: use <code>type = "war2"</code>,
the pseudo R2: use <code>type = "pr2"</code>, etc. Use <code>"cor2"</code> for the squared correlation.
By default, all R2s are computed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>full_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar, default is <code>FALSE</code>. If <code>TRUE</code> then names of the vector
in output will have full names instead of keywords (e.g. <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠Squared Correlation⁠</code>
instead of <code>cor2</code>, etc).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The pseudo R2s are the McFaddens R2s, that is the ratio of log-likelihoods.
</p>
<p>For R2s with no theoretical justification, like e.g. regular R2s for maximum likelihood
models – or within R2s for models without fixed-effects, NA is returned.
The single measure to possibly compare all kinds of models is the squared
correlation between the dependent variable and the expected predictor.
</p>
<p>The pseudo-R2 is also returned in the OLS case, it corresponds to the
pseudo-R2 of the equivalent GLM model with a Gaussian family.
</p>
<p>For the adjusted within-R2s, the adjustment factor is <code>(n - nb_fe) / (n - nb_fe - K)</code>
with <code>n</code> the number of observations, <code>nb_fe</code> the number of fixed-effects and <code>K</code>
the number of variables.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a named vector.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Load trade data
data(trade)

# We estimate the effect of distance on trade (with 3 fixed-effects)
est = feols(log(Euros) ~ log(dist_km) | Origin + Destination + Product, trade)

# Squared correlation:
r2(est, "cor2")

# "regular" r2:
r2(est, "r2")

# pseudo r2 (equivalent to GLM with Gaussian family)
r2(est, "pr2")

# adjusted within r2
r2(est, "war2")

# all four at once
r2(est, c("cor2", "r2", "pr2", "war2"))

# same with full names instead of codes
r2(est, c("cor2", "r2", "pr2", "war2"), full_names = TRUE)
