<h2>Import data from the web</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Rmetrics "fImport" package is a collection of utility functions 
to download and manage data sets from the Internet or from other 
sources.
</p>


<h3>1 Introduction</h3>

<p>The major content of this package is to provide download functions 
for financial market data from the Internet. For this we have 
implemented the web text browsers "Lynx", "Links", and "W3M"
for an easy and straightforward download of data from the Internet.   
</p>
<p>Furthermore helpful utility functions are included to split numerical 
data matrices, to split date character vectors, and to split strings 
from downloads. This allows to create in a very easy way 
<code>timeSeries</code> objects.
</p>
<p>Examples are provided for downloading data from the Federal Reserve
data base in St. Louis web portal.

</p>
<p>The data part contains instruments listings from the American Stock 
Exchange, from the FED H15 Report, from the NASDAQ Stock Market,
from the New York Stock Exchange, of OANDAs Foreign Exchange Rates,
of STOXX Indices, and from the Swiss Stock Exchange.
</p>
<p>For the download of spread sheets from the Internet we refer to the 
functions <code>gdata::read.xls</code> and <code>xlsx::read.xlsx</code> for the 
contributed <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> packages <code>gdata</code> and <code>xlsx</code> respectively.
