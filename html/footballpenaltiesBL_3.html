</dd>
<dt><code>result</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Character vector that gives the result of the penalty in German. Possible values are
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Tor</code>: Goal
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gehalten</code>: Save (abbreviation for gehalten)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>vorbei</code>: Miss (abbreviation for vorbei)

</li>
<li> <p><code>drüber</code>: Miss, too high (abbreviation for drüber)

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Pfosten</code>: Miss, hit the post (abbreviation for Pfosten)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between a save and a miss is that the goalkeeper actively stopped the ball for save, whereas
the penalty taker missed the goal without the goalkeeper touching it in the latter case.
</p>
<p>The distinction between different types of misses is included for historical reasons only. Current policy is to
distinguish between goals, saves, and misses only. Analyses that rely on <code>drüb</code>, <code>Latt</code> or <code>Pfos</code>
are likely misleading.</p>
