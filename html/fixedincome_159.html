<h2>Term class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It is the time interval used in calculations with interest rates.
The Term class represents the period used to discount or compound a spot
rate.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Term object is defined by its numeric value and its unit, that can be
<code>"days"</code>, <code>"months"</code> or <code>"years"</code>.
For example:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>term(6, "months")
#&gt; [1] "6 months"
</pre></div>
<p>It represents a period of 6 months.
The Term object can also be created from a string representation of a Term.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>as.term("6 months")
#&gt; [1] "6 months"
</pre></div>
<p>Since the Term object inherits from a <code>numeric</code>, it inherits all numeric
operations.
Numeric values can be summed or subtracted from a Term object numeric part.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>term(1, "days") + 1
#&gt; [1] "2 days"
</pre></div>
<p>Arithmetic and comparison operations between Term object are not implemented,
so these operations raise an error.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>try(term(1, "days") + term(2 , "days"))
#&gt; Error in term(1, "days") + term(2, "days") : Not implemented
</pre></div>


<h4>DateRangeTerm objects</h4>

<p>The DateRangeTerm class inherits Term and defines start and end dates
and a calendar to count the amount of working days between these two dates.
This is a Term between two dates.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>term(Sys.Date() - 5, Sys.Date(), "Brazil/ANBIMA")
#&gt; [1] "3 days"
</pre></div>
<p>In financial markets it is fairly usual to evaluate interest rates between
two dates.
