Thin plate spline regression 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits a thin plate spline surface to irregularly spaced data. The 
smoothing parameter is chosen  as a default by generalized cross-validation. The assumed 
model is additive  Y = f(X) +e  where f(X) is a d dimensional surface.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

Scale type of "user" allows specification of an x.center and
x.scale by the 
user. The default for "user" is mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Scale

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>This is the classic nonparametric curve/surface estimate pioneered in statistics by Grace Wahba. The computational algorithm is based around a QR decomposition followed by an eigen decomposition on a reduced matrix derived from the spline radial basis functions. This insures a stable computation – basically bombproof – but is not the fastest. See the function mKrig and examples for fitting a thin plate spline using spatialProcess that uses a different linear algebra approach. This is implemented in the "fast" version albeit approximate version to exploit sparse matrices. 
</p>
<p>This function also works for just a single dimension and reproduces the well known cubic smoothing spline for <code> m ==2</code> Finally we note that a thin plate spline is a limiting case of a Gaussian process estimate as the range parameter in the Matern family increases to infinity. 
(Kriging). 
</p>
<p>A "fast" version of this function uses a compactly supported Wendland covariance and sparse linear algebra for handling larger datta sets. Although a good approximation to Tps for sufficiently large aRange its actual form is very different from the textbook thin-plate definition. The user will see that <code>fastTps</code> is largely a wrapper for a call to <code>spatialProcess</code> with the Wendland covariance function. 
</p>
<p><strong>Background on the thin plate spline function, Tps</strong>
A thin plate spline is the result of minimizing the residual sum of 
squares subject to a constraint that the function have a certain 
level of smoothness (or roughness penalty). Roughness is 
quantified by the integral of squared m-th order derivatives. For one 
dimension and m=2 the roughness penalty is the integrated square of 
the second derivative of the function. For two dimensions the 
roughness penalty is the integral of  
</p>
<p>(Dxx(f))**22 + 2(Dxy(f))**2 + (Dyy(f))**22 
</p>
<p>(where Duv denotes the second partial derivative with respect to u 
and v.) Besides controlling the order of the derivatives, the value of 
m also determines the base polynomial that is fit to the data. 
The degree of this polynomial is (m-1). 
</p>
<p>The smoothing parameter controls the amount that the data is 
smoothed. In the usual form this is denoted by lambda, the Lagrange 
multiplier of the minimization problem. Although this is an awkward 
scale, lambda = 0 corresponds to no smoothness constraints and the data 
is interpolated.  lambda=infinity corresponds to just fitting the 
polynomial base model by ordinary least squares.  
</p>
<p>This estimator is implemented by passing the right generalized covariance
function based on radial basis functions to the more general function
Krig.  One advantage of this implementation is that once a Tps/Krig object
is created the estimator can be found rapidly for other data and smoothing
parameters provided the locations remain unchanged. This makes simulation
within R efficient (see example below). Tps does not currently support the
knots argument where one can use a reduced set of basis functions. This is
mainly to simplify the code and a good alternative using knots would be to use a
valid covariance from the Matern family and a large range parameter. 
</p>
<p><strong>Using a great circle distance function</strong>
The option to use great circle distance
to define the radial basis functions (<code>lon.lat=TRUE</code>) is very useful
for small geographic domains where the spherical geometry is well approximated by a plane. However, for large domains the spherical distortion be large enough that the radial basis functions no longer define a positive definite system and Tps will report a numerical error. An alternative is to switch to a three
dimensional thin plate spline with the locations being the direction cosines. This will 
give approximate great circle distances for locations that are close and also the numerical methods will always have a positive definite matrices. There are other radial basis functions that are specific to a spherical geometry but these are not implemented in fields. 
</p>
<p>Here is an example using this idea for <code>RMprecip</code> and also some 
examples of building grids and evaluating the Tps results on them:
</p>
<pre>
# a useful function:
  dircos&lt;- function(x1){
             coslat1 &lt;- cos((x1[, 2] * pi)/180)
             sinlat1 &lt;- sin((x1[, 2] * pi)/180)
             coslon1 &lt;- cos((x1[, 1] * pi)/180)
             sinlon1 &lt;- sin((x1[, 1] * pi)/180)
             cbind(coslon1*coslat1, sinlon1*coslat1, sinlat1)}
# fit in 3-d to direction cosines
  out&lt;- Tps(dircos(RMprecip$x),RMprecip$y)
  xg&lt;-make.surface.grid(fields.x.to.grid(RMprecip$x))
  fhat&lt;- predict( out, dircos(xg))
# coerce to image format from prediction vector and grid points.
  out.p&lt;- as.surface( xg, fhat)
  surface( out.p)
# compare to the automatic
  out0&lt;- Tps(RMprecip$x,RMprecip$y, lon.lat=TRUE)
  surface(out0)
</pre>
<p>The function <code>fastTps</code> is really a convenient wrapper function that
calls <code>spatialProcess</code> with a suitable Wendland covariance 
function. This means one can use all the additional functions for
prediction and simulation built for the <code>spatialProcess</code> and
<code>mKrig</code> objects.  Some care needs to exercised in specifying
the support <code>aRange</code> – a Goldilocks problem – where aRange
is large enough so that every location has a reasonable number
(say 10 or more ) of neighboring locations that have non-zero
covariances but also the number of neighbors is not so large that
the sparsity of the covariance matrix is compromised. 
To figure out the neighborhood pattern are the spatial locations one can use the function <code>nearest.dist</code>, sparse matrix format,  and <code>table</code> function. 
</p>
<pre>
set.seed(222)
s&lt;- cbind( runif(1e4),runif(1e4))
look&lt;- nearest.dist(s,s, delta = .03)
look&lt;- spam2spind(look)

stats( table( look$ind[,1]))
</pre>
<p>Here one has asummary of the number of nearest neighbors within a 
distance of .03 for these (randomly generated) locations.
I see a minimum of 7 for at least one location so aRange should be larger than .03. Trial and error with different deltas can lead to a better choice.  
</p>
<p>Note that unlike Tps the locations are not 
scaled to unit range and this can cause havoc in smoothing problems with
variables in very different units. 
So rescaling the locations <code> x&lt;- scale(x)</code> 
is a good idea for putting the variables on a common scale
for smoothing.  A conservative rule of thumb is to make <code>aRange</code>
large enough so that about 50 nearest neighbors are within this distance
for every observation location. 
</p>
<p>This function does have the potential to approximate estimates of Tps 
for very large spatial data sets. See <code>wendland.cov</code> and help on 
the SPAM package, and the friendly spind format for more background.
Also, the function <code>predictSurface.fastTps</code> has been made more
efficient for the 
case of k=2 and m=2 – a common choice for parameters.
</p>
