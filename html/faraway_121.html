<h2>Post traumatic stress disorder in abused adult females</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data for this example come from a study of the effects of childhood
sexual abuse on adult females. 45 women being treated at a clinic, who
reported childhood sexual abuse, were measured for post traumatic stress
disorder and childhood physical abuse both on standardized scales. 31 women
also being treated at the same clinic, who did not report childhood sexual
abuse were also measured. The full study was more complex than reported here
and so readers interested in the subject matter should refer to the original
article.
