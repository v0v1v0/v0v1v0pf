</p>

<dl>
<dt>ward</dt>
<dd>
<p>ward of the residence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>turnout_98</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator variable for voting in the 1998
general election.</p>
</dd>
<dt>inperson</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator variable for if the respondent received
in-person canvassing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>phone</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator variable for if the respondent received
phone canvassing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>inperson_rand</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator variable for if the respondent was
randomized to receive in-person canvassing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>phone_rand</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator variable for if the respondent was
randomized to receive phone canvassing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>respondent age.</p>
</dd>
<dt>maj_party</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator variable for if the respondent is a

</dd>
<dt>turnout_96</dt>

</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data was cleaned and used in Bowers and Hansen (2009). It was a 2x2
factorial design with noncompliance on both factors. This is the
subset of the subjects who lived in a single-person household and
were not randomized to receive get-out-the-vote mailers. Blackwell
(2017) analyzed the full data adjusting for noncompliance.
