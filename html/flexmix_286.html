<h2>Tribolium Beetles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data investigates whether the adult Tribolium species Castaneum has
developed an evolutionary advantage to recognize and avoid eggs of
their own species while foraging.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("tribolium")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 27 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Remaining</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Total</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Replicate</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with levels <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Species</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with levels <code>Castaneum</code> <code>Confusum</code> <code>Madens</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Beetles of the genus Tribolium are cannibalistic in the sense that
adults eat the eggs of their own species as well as those of closely
related species. The experiment isolated a number of adult beetles of
the same species and presented them with a vial of 150 eggs (50 of
each type), the eggs being thoroughly mixed to ensure uniformity
throughout the vial.
</p>
<p>The data gives the consumption data for adult Castaneum species. It
reports the number of Castaneum, Confusum and Madens eggs,
respectively, that remain uneaten after two day exposure to the adult
beetles. Replicates 1, 2, and 3 correspond to different occasions on
which the experiment was conducted.
