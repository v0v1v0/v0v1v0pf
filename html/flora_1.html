<h2>Package flora</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Collect data from the Brazilian Flora checklist
(http://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package contains a set of tools solving problems that arise when one has
to collect taxonomic and distribution information for large datasets of
plants. Interacting with the Brazilian Flora Checklist website from a web browser is
often a slow and somewhat cumbersome process, especially if you are not sure
about the correct spelling of a name. With flora, however, you can:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>get a suggestion for the correct spelling of a name from an incorrect one
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>search for its current taxonomic status
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get its author(s), synonym(s), family, distribution, and lower taxa
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>process lists of names and automatically solve synonyms and typing errors
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>flora now holds all the data it needs. All functions can be used whilst offline.
