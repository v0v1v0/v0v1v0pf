<h2> Function to provide large (at least 8192 runs) regular Fractional Factorial designs 
that are not necessarily optimal, especially large resolution V designs.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Large regular fractional factorial 2-level designs in 8192 or more runs are provided: 
Resolution V designs in 8096 to 32768 runs with up to 120 factors according to the suggestion by Sanchez and Sanchez 2005 
are automatically created (these are not necessarily optimal). Furthermore, manual generation 
of large regular fractional factorial designs via specification of generators is possible.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">FrF2Large(nruns, nfactors = NULL, factor.names = if (!is.null(nfactors)){ 
    if (nfactors &lt;= 50) 
        Letters[1:nfactors]
    else paste("F", 1:nfactors, sep = "")
    } else NULL, 
    default.levels = c(-1, 1), ncenter = 0, center.distribute = NULL, 
    generators = NULL, 
    replications = 1, repeat.only = FALSE, 
    randomize = TRUE, seed = NULL, alias.info = 2, ...) 
nrunsV(nfactors)    
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>nruns</code></td>
<td>
<p> Number of runs, must be a power of 2 (8192 to 32768). 
</p>
<p>The number of runs must match the number of factors. Function <code>nrunsV</code> 
can be used for determining the number of runs needed for a resolution V design, 
and for advice on the function to be used.<br>
For more detail on specification of the number of runs, see the Details section.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nfactors</code></td>
<td>
<p> is the number of 2-level factors to be investigated. 
It can be omitted, if it is obvious from options <code>factor.names</code> or

<p> a character vector of <code>nfactors</code> factor names

if the list is named, list names represent factor names, otherwise default factor names are used;<br> 
the elements of the list are <br>
EITHER vectors of length 2 with factor levels for the respective factor<br>
OR empty strings. 
For each factor with an empty string in factor.names, the levels given in 
<code>default.levels</code> are used;<br>
Default factor names are the first elements of the character vector <code>Letters</code>, 
or the factors position numbers preceded by capital F in case of more than 50 factors. </p>

<p> number of center points per block; <code>ncenter &gt; 0</code> 
is permitted, if all factors are quantitative and the design is not a split-plot design </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>center.distribute</code></td>
<td>
<p> the number of positions over which the center points 
are to be distributed for each block; if NULL (default), center points are 
distributed over end, beginning, and middle (in that order, if there are fewer than three center points) 
for randomized designs, and appended to the end for non-randomized designs. 
for more detail, see function <code>add.center</code>, which does the work.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>generators</code></td>
<td>
<p> There are <code>log2(nruns)</code> base factors the full factorial 
of which spans the design (e.g. 10 for 1024 runs). 
The generators specify how the remaining factors 
are to be allocated to interactions of these. <br>
WARNING: Of course, with manual 
specification of generators, the structure of the design is in the users 
responsibility; the function only prevents confounding of two main effects with each 
other.
</p>
<p><code>generators</code> can be 
</p>
<p>a list of vectors with position numbers of base factors (e.g. c(1,3,4) 
stands for the interaction between first, third and fourth base factor) 
</p>
<p>a vector of character representations of these interactions, 
e.g. “ACD” stands for the same interaction as above
</p>
<p>a vector of columns numbers in Yates order (e.g. 13 stands for ACD). 
Note that the columns 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., i.e. all powers of 2, are reserved 
for the base factors and cannot be used for assigning additional factors, 
because the design would become a resolution II design. For looking up 
which column number stands for which interaction, type e.g. 
<code>names(Yates)[1:15]</code> for a 16 run design.
</p>
<p>WARNING: Contrary to function <code>FrF2</code>, it is not possible to 
precede generator entries with a minus sign for reversing column levels; 
instead, the levels must be swapped.

<td><code>replications</code></td>
<td>
<p> positive integer number. Default 1 (i.e. each row just once). 
If larger, each design run is executed replication times. 
If <code>repeat.only</code>, repeated measurements 
are carried out directly in sequence, i.e. no true replication takes place, 
and all the repeat runs are conducted together. It is likely that the error 
variation generated by such a procedure will be too small, so that average values 
should be analyzed for an unreplicated design. 
</p>
<p>Otherwise (default), the full experiment is first carried out once, then 
for the second replication and so forth. In case of randomization, 
each such blocks is randomized separately. In this case, replication variance is 
more likely suitable for usage as error variance 
(unless e.g. the same parts are used for replication runs although build 
variation is important).</p>

<p> logical, relevant only if replications &gt; 1. If TRUE, 
replications of each run are grouped together

is conducted in <code>replications</code> blocks, and each run occurs in each block.  </p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>randomize</code></td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If generators are not explicitly specified, function <code>FrF2Large</code> creates a 
resolution V design according to the 
rules by Sanchez and Sanchez (2005) for the specified number of factors in 
the specified number of runs. The Sanchez and Sanchez article offers designs with <br>
at least 1024 runs for 25 to 29 factors (1024 up to 33 factors with <code>FrF2</code>),<br>
at least 2048 runs for 30 to 38 factors (2048 up to 47 factors with <code>FrF2</code>),<br>
at least 4096 runs for 39 to 52 factors (4096 up to 65 factors with <code>FrF2</code>),<br>
at least 8192 runs for 53 to 69 factors (up to 65 factors in half the run size with <code>FrF2</code>),<br>
at least 16384 runs for 70 to 92 factors, (<br>
at least 32768 runs for 93 to 120 factors.<br>
For designs with up to 4096 runs, function <code>FrF2</code> 
creates better automatic designs. 
Therefore, function <code>FrF2Large</code> is restricted to usage for larger designs. 
</p>
<p>Users can explicitly specify a design through specifying 
generators via the <code>generators</code> option. For up to 4096 runs, this is also possible 
with function <code>FrF2</code>, even with more flexibility. Therefore, manual design generation 
with function <code>FrF2Large</code> is also restricted to designs of at least 8192 runs.
</p>
<p>Manual generation of large designs with the option <code>generators</code> is limited by 
computer memory only. <code>nruns</code> must be at least large enough to accomodate the 
rightmost generator column; for example, if generators contains an element <code>ABEP</code>, 
<code>P</code> is the 15th base factor (15th letter in <code>Letters</code>), 
i.e. <code>nruns</code> must be at least <code>2^15</code>=32768;
if the largest generator column number in Yates column notation is 4201, 
<code>nruns</code> must be at least <code>2^ceiling(log2(4201))</code>=8192. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function <code>nrunsV</code> invisibly returns the number of runs requested and 
prints a message with the number of runs and the appropriate function.
</p>
<p>Function <code>FrF2Large</code> returns a data frame of S3 class 
<code>design</code> 
and has attached attributes that can be accessed 
by functions <code>desnum</code>, 
<code>run.order</code> and 
<code>design.info</code>. 
</p>
<p>The data frame itself contains the design with levels coded as requested. 
If no center points have been requested, the design columns are factors with 
contrasts <code>-1</code> and <code>+1</code> (cf. also <code>contr.FrF2</code>); in case 
of center points, the design columns are numeric.
</p>
<p>The following attributes are attached to it:

<td><code>desnum</code></td>
<td>
<p>Design matrix in -1/1 coding</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>run.order</code></td>
<td>
<p>three column data frame, first column contains the run number in 
standard order, second column the run number as randomized, third column the 
run number with replication number as postfix;
useful for switching back and forth between actual and standard run 
number</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Since R version 3.6.0, the behavior of function <code>sample</code> has changed 
(correction of a biased previous behavior that might be relevant for the randomization 
of very large designs). 
For reproducing a randomized design that was produced with an earlier R version, 
please follow the steps described with the argument <code>seed</code>.
