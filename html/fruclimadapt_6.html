<h2>Calculation of chill units from hourly temperature data (Utah model)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function calculates chill units using the Utah model (Richardson
et al, 1974). This model is characterized by differential weighting of
temperature ranges, including negative weights for temperatures
above 15.9Â°C. This model recognizes that different temperatures
vary in effectiveness in accumulating chill as well as a negative
influence of high temperatures on previously accumulated chill.
Chill Units (Utah or Anderson model) perform better than chill hours
for a wider range of climates, and it could be considered as the
'reference' method nowadays, but it is ill-suited for warm or
Mediterranean conditions. To date, Chill portions is the best
existing model for most growing regions, so chill fulfilment
should preferably be calculated using that method, especially
when transferring varieties from one region to another, or in
studies on climate change.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">chill_units(climdata, Start)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>climdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dataframe with hourly temperature data. It
must contain the columns Year, Month, Day, DOY, Temp.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Start</code></td>
<td>
<p>parameter indicating the day of the year when chill
accumulation is supposed to start.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>dataframe with the chill accumulated for all the seasons in the
dataset. Seasons begin at the start date and end the day before the start
date of the following year.
It contains the columns Year, Month, Day, DOY, Chill
