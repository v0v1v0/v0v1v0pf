<h2>Multivariate meta-analysis for FluMoDL objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function runs multivariate meta-analysis (using package <code>mvmeta</code>)
on the first-stage coefficients of influenza (and possibly RSV) incidence proxies
for multiple 'FluMoDL' object summaries.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">metaFluMoDL(summaries, par = c("H1", "H3", "B", "RSV"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>summaries</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <em>list</em> of objects of class <code>summary.FluMoDL</code>
(at least two), representing the first-stage analyses. If the list is named, the
names are kept in the output object and can be retrieved with <code>names()</code>, see below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>par</code></td>
<td>
<p>For which model terms (sets of coefficients) to run the meta-analysis?
Defaults to <code>c("H1","H3","B","RSV")</code>, which
indicates all three influenza proxies and RSV (for those summaries that have included
an RSV term). It is unlikely that you'll want to alter this default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns an object of class 'metaFluMoDL'. This is a list of objects of class
<code>mvmeta</code>, representing the results of the multivariate
random-effects meta-analysis for the sets of coefficients corresponding to each
term in argument <code>par</code>; they can be accessed directly using the <code>$</code>
operator as <code>$proxyH1</code>, <code>$proxyH3</code> and <code>$proxyB</code> (and also
<code>$proxyRSV</code> if there were RSV terms in at least two elements of
<code>summaries</code> and <code>par</code> included "RSV" – in which case,
<code>hasRSV()</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> for objects of class 'metaFluMoDL').
</p>
<p><em>However</em>, some methods have been redefined for class 'metaFluMoDL', and do not
work the same as in simple lists. In particular: <code>length()</code>
returns the number of summaries (number of "studies") meta-analyzed and
<code>names()</code> returns the names of these summaries (if the list
in <code>summaries</code> argument was named).
</p>
<p>In addition, the <code>[[</code> and <code>[</code> operators have been redefined for class
'metaFluMoDL', and now return the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP)
estimates for the selected summaries ("studies"), as objects of class
<code>summary.FluMoDL</code>; selection can be made the usual way,
with a logical or numeric index vector, or with the summary names
(as provided by <code>names</code>). <code>[</code> returns a <em>list</em> of
<code>summary.FluMoDL</code> objects, whereas <code>[[</code> returns a single object.
The returned objects contain the string "blup" in their <code>$type</code> element,
to distinguish them from <code>first-stage model summaries</code>
or <code>pooled</code>
result summaries. In their <code>$description</code> element, they contain the
name of the respective summary ("study") if a named list had been provided
in the <code>summaries</code> argument of <code>metaFluMoDL()</code>. And finally, they contain
no <code>$pred</code> element, as they are not associated with a particular dataset and
cross-basis matrices (which is a prerequisite to create
<code>crosspred</code> objects).
</p>
<p>The pooled coefficients (for all three or four incidence proxies) can be obtained
with function <code>pooled()</code>, which also returns an object of class
<code>summary.FluMoDL</code> that you can further use.
