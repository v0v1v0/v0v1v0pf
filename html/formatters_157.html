<h2>Transform a vector of spans (with duplication) into a visibility vector</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transform a vector of spans (with duplication) into a visibility vector
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">spans_to_viscell(spans)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>spans</code></td>
<td>
<p>(<code>numeric</code>)<br> a vector of spans, with each span value repeated
for the cells it covers.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The values of <code>spans</code> are assumed to be repeated such that each individual position covered by the
span has the repeated value.
</p>
<p>This means that each block of values in <code>spans</code> must be of a length at least equal to its value
(i.e. two 2s, three 3s, etc).
</p>
<p>This function correctly handles cases where two spans of the same size are next to each other;
i.e., a block of four 2s represents two large cells each of which spans two individual cells.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A logical vector the same length as <code>spans</code> indicating whether the contents of a string vector
with those spans is valid.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Currently no checking or enforcement is done to verify that the vector of spans is valid according to
the specifications described in the Details section above.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">spans_to_viscell(c(2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3))

</code></pre>
