<h2>Concrete Compressive Strength Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data were collected by I-Cheng Yeh to determine how the compressive
strength of concrete is related to its ingredients (cement, blast furnace
slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine
aggregate) and age.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>Concrete</code> is a data frame with the following 
variables.
</p>
 
<dl>
<dt>limestone</dt>
<dd>
<p> percentage of limestone</p>
</dd>
<dt>water</dt>
<dd>
<p> water-cement ratio</p>
</dd>
<dt>strength</dt>
<dd>
<p> compressive strength (MPa) after 28 days</p>
</dd>
</dl>

the Sciences (6th ed).  The variables have been renamed.
