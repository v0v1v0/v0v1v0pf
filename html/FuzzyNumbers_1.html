<h2>Tools to Deal with Fuzzy Numbers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">FuzzyNumbers</span> is an open source (LGPL 3) package for R.
It provides S4 classes and methods to deal with fuzzy numbers.
The package may be used by researchers
in fuzzy numbers theory (e.g., for testing new algorithms,
generating numerical examples, preparing figures).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Fuzzy set theory gives one of many ways (in particular, see Bayesian
probabilities) to represent imprecise
information. Fuzzy numbers form a particular subclass of fuzzy sets
of the real line. The main idea behind this concept is motivated by
the observation that people tend to describe their knowledge
about objects through vague numbers, e.g., "I'm about 180 cm tall" or
"The event happened between 2 and 3 p.m.".
</p>
<p>For the formal definition of a fuzzy number
please refer to the <code>FuzzyNumber</code> man page.
Note that this package also deals with particular types
of fuzzy numbers like trapezoidal, piecewise linear, or “parametric” FNs
(see <code>TrapezoidalFuzzyNumber</code>
<code>PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumber</code>,
<code>PowerFuzzyNumber</code>, and *EXPERIMENTAL*
<code>DiscontinuousFuzzyNumber</code>)
</p>
<p>The package aims to provide the following functionality:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Representation of arbitrary fuzzy numbers
(including FNs with discontinuous side functions and/or alpha-cuts),
as well as their particular types, e.g. trapezoidal and piecewise linear fuzzy numbers,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Defuzzification and approximation by triangular
and piecewise linear FNs (see e.g. <code>expectedValue</code>,
<code>value</code>, <code>trapezoidalApproximation</code>,
<code>piecewiseLinearApproximation</code>),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Visualization of FNs (see <code>plot</code>, <code>as.character</code>),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Basic operations on FNs (see e.g. <code>fapply</code> and Arithmetic),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> etc.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a complete list of classes and methods
call <code>help(package="FuzzyNumbers")</code>.
Moreover, you will surely be interested in a step-by-step guide to the
package usage and features which is available at the project's webpage.
