<h2>Matched Groups</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>MG</code> returns the matched groups of the supplied units.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">MG(units, ame_out, multiple = FALSE, id_only = FALSE, index_only)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>units</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of units whose matched groups are desired.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ame_out</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>ame</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>multiple</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical scalar. If <code>FALSE</code> (default), then <code>MG</code>
will only return the main matched group for each unit. See below for
details. Cannot be set to <code>TRUE</code> if <code>ame_out</code> was generated
without replacement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>id_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical scalar. If <code>TRUE</code>, then only the IDs of the
units in each matched group are returned, and not their treatment, outcome,
or covariate information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>index_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>Defunct. Use 'id_only' instead.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>units</code> argument refers to units with respect to
<code>rownames(ame_out$data)</code>. Typically, this will also correspond to the
indexing of the data (i.e. passing <code>units = 3</code> will return the matched
group of the 3rd unit in the matching data). However, if a separate holdout
set was not passed to the matching algorithm or if the original matching data
had rownames other than <code>1:nrow(data)</code>, then this is not the case.
</p>
<p>The <code>multiple</code> argument toggles whether only a unit's main matched group
(MMG) or all matched groups a unit is part of should be returned. A unit's
MMG contains its highest quality matches (that is, the units with which it
first matched in the sequence of considered covariate sets). If the original
call that generated <code>ame_out</code> specified <code>replace = FALSE</code> then
units only are part of one matched group (which is also their MMG) and
<code>multiple</code> must be set to <code>FALSE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of length <code>length(units)</code>, each entry of which corresponds to a
different unit in <code>units</code>. For matched units, if <code>multiple =
  FALSE</code>, each entry is 1. a data frame containing the treatment and outcome
information of members of the matched group, along with covariates they
were matched on if <code>id_only = FALSE</code> or 2. a vector of the IDs of
matched units if <code>id_only = TRUE</code> . If <code>multiple = TRUE</code>, each
entry of the returned list is a list containing the previously described
information, but with each entry corresponding to a different matched
group. In either case, entries corresponding to unmatched units are
<code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
data &lt;- gen_data()
holdout &lt;- gen_data()
FLAME_out &lt;- FLAME(data = data, holdout = holdout, replace = TRUE)

# Only the main matched group of unit 1
MG(1, FLAME_out, multiple = F)

# All matched groups of unit 1
MG(1, FLAME_out, multiple = T)

## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
