Assume that the exact scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are as follows:
If program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.
If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved 
and a 2/3 probability that nobody will be saved.
Which of the two programs would you favor?

</p>
<p>If program A is adopted, 400 people will die.
If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and a 2/3 probability
