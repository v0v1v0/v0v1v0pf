<h2>Goose permits</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a 1979 study by Bishop and Heberlein, 237 hunters were each offered one of 
11 cash amounts (bids) ranging from $1 to $200 in return for their hunting permits.
The data records how many hunters offered each bid kept or sold their permit.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 11 rows and 5 columns.  
Each row corresponds to a bid (in US dollars)
offered for a goose permit.  The colums <code>keep</code> and <code>sell</code> indicate 
how many hunters offered that bid kept or sold their permit, respectively.
<code>n</code> is the sum of <code>keep</code> and <code>sell</code> and <code>prop_sell</code>
is the proportion that sold.
