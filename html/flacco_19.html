<h2>Feature Importance Plot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a feature importance plot.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ggplotFeatureImportance(featureList, control = list(), ...)

plotFeatureImportance(featureList, control = list(), ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>featureList</code></td>
<td>
<p>[<code>list</code>]<br>
List of vectors of features. One list element is expected to belong to
one resampling iteration / fold.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>control</code></td>
<td>
<p>[<code>list</code>]<br>
A list, which stores additional configuration parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.col_{high/medium/low}</code>: Color of the features, which
are used often, sometimes or only a few times.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.perc_{high/low}</code>: Percentage of the total number of folds,
defining when a features, is used often, sometimes or only a few times.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.las</code>: Alignment of axis labels.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.lab_{feat/resample}</code>: Axis labels (features and resample iterations).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.string_angle</code>: Angle for the features on the x-axis.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.pch_{active/inactive}</code>: Plot symbol of the active and
inactive points.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.col_inactive</code>: Color of the inactive points.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.col_vertical</code>: Color of the vertical lines.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.lab_{title/strip}</code>: Label used for the title and/or strip label.
These parameters are only relevant for <code>ggplotFeatureImportance</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.legend_position</code>: Location of the legend.
This parameter is only relevant for <code>ggplotFeatureImportance</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.flip_axes</code>: Should the axes be flipped?
This parameter is only relevant for <code>ggplotFeatureImportance</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>featimp.plot_tiles</code>: Visualize (non-)selected features with tiles?
This parameter is only relevant for <code>ggplotFeatureImportance</code>.
</p>
</li>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>[<code>plot</code>].<br>
Feature Importance Plot, indicating which feature was used during which iteration.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# At the beginning, one needs a list of features, e.g. derived during a
# nested feature selection within mlr (see the following 8 steps):
library(mlr)
library(mlbench)
data(Glass)

# (1) Create a classification task:
classifTask = makeClassifTask(data = Glass, target = "Type")

# (2) Define the model (here, a classification tree):
lrn = makeLearner(cl = "classif.rpart")

# (3) Define the resampling strategy, which is supposed to be used within 
# each inner loop of the nested feature selection:
innerResampling = makeResampleDesc("Holdout")

# (4) What kind of feature selection approach should be used? Here, we use a
# sequential backward strategy, i.e. starting from a model with all features,
# in each step the feature decreasing the performance measure the least is
# removed from the model:
ctrl = makeFeatSelControlSequential(method = "sbs")

# (5) Wrap the original model (see (2)) in order to allow feature selection:
wrappedLearner = makeFeatSelWrapper(learner = lrn,
  resampling = innerResampling, control = ctrl)

# (6) Define a resampling strategy for the outer loop. This is necessary in
# order to assess whether the selected features depend on the underlying
# fold:
outerResampling = makeResampleDesc(method = "CV", iters = 10L)

# (7) Perform the feature selection:
featselResult = resample(learner = wrappedLearner, task = classifTask,
  resampling = outerResampling, models = TRUE)

# (8) Extract the features, which were selected during each iteration of the
# outer loop (i.e. during each of the 10 folds of the cross-validation):
featureList = lapply(featselResult$models, 
  function(mod) getFeatSelResult(mod)$x)
## End(Not run)

########################################################################

# Now, one could inspect the features manually:
featureList

# Alternatively, one might use visual means such as the feature
# importance plot. There exist two versions for the feature importance
# plot. One based on the classical R figures
plotFeatureImportance(featureList)

# and one using ggplot
ggplotFeatureImportance(featureList)
