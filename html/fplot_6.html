<h2>Aggregate/conditional graphs and automatic layout using formulas</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">fplot</span> provides automatic plotting of common graphs (distributions, lines, bar plots and boxplots). The syntax uses formulas, allowing aggregate/conditional/weighted graphs with minimum efforts. The many arguments are automatically adjusted to the data in order to provide the nicest and most meaningful graphs.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The core functions is <code>plot_distr</code> to draw distributions.
Two other graphical functions are provided for convenience: <code>plot_lines</code> to represent the (usually temporal) evolution of some variables, and <code>plot_box</code> to easily represent conditional boxplots.
</p>
<p>It also integrates tools to easily export graphs: <code>pdf_fit</code> and <code>png_fit</code>. In these functions, instead of providing the size of the graphics, you instead give the point size that the text should have in the final documentâ€“because an exported graph usually ends up in a document. You can set the size of your document with the function <code>setFplot_page</code>. If you use the function <code>fit.off</code> to close the connection, you will also see how the export looks like in the Viewer pane.
