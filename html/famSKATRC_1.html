<h2>
Family Sequence Kernel Association Test for Rare and Common Variants
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>FamSKAT-RC is a family-based association kernel test for both 
rare and common variants. This test is general and several special cases 
are known as other methods: famSKAT, which only focuses on rare variants 
in family-based data, SKAT, which focuses on rare variants in 
population-based data (unrelated individuals), and SKAT-RC, which focuses 
on both rare and common variants in population-based data. When one 
applies famSKAT-RC and sets the value of phi to 1, famSKAT-RC becomes 
famSKAT. When one applies famSKAT-RC and set the value of phi to 1 and the 
kinship matrix to the identity matrix, famSKAT-RC becomes SKAT. When one 
applies famSKAT-RC and set the kinship matrix (fullkins) to the identity 
matrix (and phi is not equal to 1), famSKAT-RC becomes SKAT-RC. We also 
include a small sample synthetic pedigree to demonstrate the method with.
