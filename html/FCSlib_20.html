<h2>Line-scan data of HEK-293 cells expressing Venus (EYFP) dimers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set consists on a raster line scan performed over HEK-293 cells expressing dimers of the fluorescent protein Venus, also known as SEYFP-F46L.
The scan line is 64 pixels long, and the scanning direction is from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, across the nuclear envelope.
A pixel size of 50 nm was used, as well as a pixel dwell time of 12.5 us and a line scan time of 1.925 ms.
Fluorescence excitation was provided by a 488 nm laser at 0.1
Fluorescence intensity data was collected using the photon-counting mode in an Olympus FV1000 Upright BX61WI confocal microscope.
