<h2>
Bring modelled and measured values together based on timestamp
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Trivial function that is a simple wrapper for frequent task: Bringing together the measured and modelled values, for instance to do a posteriori analyses of model performance. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">checkm(modelled, measured, t.unit = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>modelled</code></td>
<td>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with the modelled fluxes and all additional data reported. For instance resulting from doing <code>budget.reco</code> on a "<code>breco</code>" object. One variable has to be the timestamp and it should be named exactly like this.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>measured</code></td>
<td>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with the originally measured fluxes and additional data. One variable has to be the timestamp and it should be named exactly like this.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t.unit</code></td>
<td>

<p>If NULL, data in <code>modelled</code> and <code>measured</code> are merged based on their timestamp by calculating the minimum difference in time between all entries (see Details). If !NULL, character string specifying to which time interval the timestamps in <code>measured</code> should be rounded using <code>round.POSIXlt</code>. May be one of <code>"mins"</code>, <code>"5mins"</code>, <code>"10mins"</code>, <code>"15mins"</code>, <code>"quarter hours"</code>, <code>"30mins"</code>, <code>"half hours"</code>, <code>"hours"</code>. Alternatively, a numeric specifying the minutes to round to. To go to seconds just use values &lt; 1, to go beyond the hour just use values &gt; 60.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><b>Case 1 (t.unit = NULL)</b> Data are merged by calculating the difference in time between all timestamps in <code>modelled</code> and all timestamps in <code>measured</code> and identifying the minimum difference to each measured flux. If minimum difference between measured and modelled flux &gt; 1h, no modelled flux is assigned. This approach is a bit slower but it is not necessary to give a correct <code>t.unit</code>, which makes it less error prone.
</p>
<p><b>Case 2 (t.unit != NULL)</b> After rounding the timestamps in <code>measured</code> according to <code>t.unit</code> and transforming both timestamnps to character vectors <code>modelled</code> and <code>measured</code> are merged based on these  timestamps and only data rows that are present in both are retained. Therefore <code>t.unit</code> has to be specified according to the interval of the timestamps in <code>modelled</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data.frame containing the corresponding rows of <code>modelled</code> and <code>measured</code>
