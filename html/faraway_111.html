<h2>Rabbit weight gain by diet and litter</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A nutritionist studied the effects of six diets, on weight gain of domestic
rabbits.  From past experience with sizes of litters, it was felt that only
3 uniform rabbits could be selected from each available litter. There were
ten litters available forming blocks of size three.
