<h2>Total length of stay in particular states for a fully-parametric,
time-inhomogeneous Markov multi-state model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The matrix whose <code class="reqn">r,s</code> entry is the expected amount of time spent in
state <code class="reqn">s</code> for a time-inhomogeneous, continuous-time Markov multi-state
process that starts in state <code class="reqn">r</code>, up to a maximum time <code class="reqn">t</code>. This is
defined as the integral of the corresponding transition probability up to
that time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">totlos.fs(
  x,
  trans = NULL,
  t = 1,
  newdata = NULL,
  ci = FALSE,
  tvar = "trans",
  sing.inf = 1e+10,
  B = 1000,
  cl = 0.95,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A model fitted with <code>flexsurvreg</code>.  See
<code>msfit.flexsurvreg</code> for the required form of the model and the
data.  Additionally, this must be a Markov / clock-forward model, but can
be time-inhomogeneous.  See the package vignette for further explanation.
</p>
<p><code>x</code> can also be a list of models, with one component for each
permitted transition, as illustrated in <code>msfit.flexsurvreg</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trans</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix indicating allowed transitions.  See
<code>msfit.flexsurvreg</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t</code></td>
<td>
<p>Time or vector of times to predict up to.  Must be finite.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame specifying the values of covariates in the
fitted model, other than the transition number.  See
<code>msfit.flexsurvreg</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ci</code></td>
<td>
<p>Return a confidence interval calculated by simulating from the
asymptotic normal distribution of the maximum likelihood estimates.  Turned
off by default, since this is computationally intensive.  If turned on,
users should increase <code>B</code> until the results reach the desired
precision.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Variable in the data representing the transition type. Not
required if <code>x</code> is a list of models.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sing.inf</code></td>
<td>
<p>If there is a singularity in the observed hazard, for
example a Weibull distribution with <code>shape &lt; 1</code> has infinite hazard at
<code>t=0</code>, then as a workaround, the hazard is assumed to be a large
finite number, <code>sing.inf</code>, at this time.  The results should not be
sensitive to the exact value assumed, but users should make sure by
adjusting this parameter in these cases.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of simulations from the normal asymptotic distribution used
to calculate variances.  Decrease for greater speed at the expense of
accuracy.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cl</code></td>
<td>
<p>Width of symmetric confidence intervals, relative to 1.</p>
</td>

<p>Arguments passed to <code>ode</code> in <span class="pkg">deSolve</span>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is computed by solving a second order extension of the Kolmogorov
forward differential equation numerically, using the methods in the
<span class="pkg">deSolve</span> package.  The equation is expressed as a linear
system
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = P(t)</code>
</p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = P(t) Q(t)</code>
</p>

<p>and solved for <code class="reqn">T(t)</code> and <code class="reqn">P(t)</code> simultaneously, where <code class="reqn">T(t)</code>
is the matrix of total lengths of stay, <code class="reqn">P(t)</code> is the transition
probability matrix for time <code class="reqn">t</code>, and <code class="reqn">Q(t)</code> is the transition
hazard or intensity as a function of <code class="reqn">t</code>.  The initial conditions are
<code class="reqn">T(0) = 0</code> and <code class="reqn">P(0) = I</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that the package <span class="pkg">msm</span> has a similar method <code>totlos.msm</code>.
<code>totlos.fs</code> should give the same results as <code>totlos.msm</code> when
both of these conditions hold:
</p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p> the time-to-event distribution is exponential for all
transitions, thus the <code>flexsurvreg</code> model was fitted with
<code>dist="exp"</code>, and is time-homogeneous.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the <span class="pkg">msm</span> model was
fitted with <code>exacttimes=TRUE</code>, thus all the event times are known, and
there are no time-dependent covariates.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pkg">msm</span> only allows exponential or piecewise-exponential time-to-event
distributions, while <span class="pkg">flexsurvreg</span> allows more flexible models.
<span class="pkg">msm</span> however was designed in particular for panel data, where the
process is observed only at arbitrary times, thus the times of transition
are unknown, which makes flexible models difficult.
</p>
<p>This function is only valid for Markov ("clock-forward") multi-state
models, though no warning or error is currently given if the model is not
Markov.  See <code>totlos.simfs</code> for the equivalent for semi-Markov
("clock-reset") models.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The matrix of lengths of stay <code class="reqn">T(t)</code>, if <code>t</code> is of length
1, or a list of matrices if <code>t</code> is longer.
</p>
<p>If <code>ci=TRUE</code>, each element has attributes <code>"lower"</code> and
<code>"upper"</code> giving matrices of the corresponding confidence limits.
These are formatted for printing but may be extracted using <code>attr()</code>.
</p>
<p>The result also has an attribute <code>P</code> giving the transition probability
matrices, since these are unavoidably computed as a side effect.  These are
suppressed for printing, but can be extracted with <code>attr(...,"P")</code>.
