<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Exeter is a city in the county of Devon which is in Britain.  The four
districts can be briefly described as follows. District 1 was a
long-established residential area near the city centre, with housing dating
from the late nineteenth century. Originally working class, it now has a
considerable middle class population with some student and other temporary
accommodation. District 2 was a working-class housing estate dating from the
1930s, with mainly rented accommodation but some owner occupation. District
3 was the oldest part of a more recently developed, mainly middle-class,
almost exclusively owner-occupied estate, dating from the 1960s. District 4
was the most recently developed part of a more sought-after middle-class
residential area, with smaller but almost entirely owner-occupied properties
dating from the 1970s and 1980s.
