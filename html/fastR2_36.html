<h2>Punting helium- and air-filled footballs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two identical footballs, one air-filled and one helium-filled, were used
outdoors on a windless day at The Ohio State University's athletic complex.
Each football was kicked 39 times and the two footballs were alternated with
each kick. The experimenter recorded the distance traveled by each ball.
