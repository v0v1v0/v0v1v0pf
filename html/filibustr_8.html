<p><strong>Senate sessions explained</strong>
</p>
<p>That webpage provides this explanation of Senate sessions:
</p>
<p><em>Prior to the 74th Congress (1935-1937), the first session of a Congress
officially began on March 4 of odd-numbered years and ended at midnight
on March 3 of odd-numbered years. Since 1935, in accordance with the
20th Amendment to the Constitution, Congresses have begun and ended at noon
on January 3 of odd-numbered years. Each two-year Congress typically
includes two legislative sessions, although third or special sessions were
common in earlier years.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>The <code>session</code> column</strong>
</p>
<p>The <code>session</code> column is type factor, with the following levels:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>levels(get_senate_sessions()$session)
#&gt; [1] "1" "2" "3" "4" "S"
</pre></div>
<p>The Senate has had just 2 sessions in each Congress since 1941, so if you
are just working with more recent data, you could convert this column to
numeric. However, if you are working with pre-1941 data, you will likely
be dealing with special sessions (denoted <code>"S"</code>), not just numbered
sessions.
