<h2>Construct, manage and store contract specifications for trading</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transaction-oriented infrastructure for defining tradable instruments based 
on their contract specifications.  Construct and manage the definition of any 
asset class, including derivatives, exotics and currencies.  Potentially 
useful for portfolio accounting, backtesting, pre-trade pricing and other 
financial research.  Still in active development.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The FinancialInstrument package provides a construct for defining and storing 
meta-data for tradable contracts (referred to as instruments, e.g., stocks, 
futures, options, etc.).  It can be used to create any asset class and 
derivatives, across multiple currencies.
</p>
<p>FinancialInstrument was originally part of a companion package, blotter, that 
provides portfolio accounting functionality.  Blotter accumulates 
transactions into positions, then into portfolios and an account.  
FinancialInstrument is used to contain the meta-data about an instrument, 
which blotter uses to calculate the notional value of positions and the 
resulting P&amp;L.  FinancialInstrument, however, has plenty of utility beyond 
portfolio accounting, and was carved out so that others might take advantage 
of its functionality.
</p>
<p>As used here, 'instruments' are S3 objects of type 'instrument' or a subclass 
thereof that define contract specifications for price series for a tradable 
contract, such as corn futures or IBM common stock.  When defined as 
instruments, these objects are extended to include descriptive information 
and contract specifications that help identify and value the contract.
</p>
<p>A simple example of an instrument is a common stock.  An instrument can be 
defined in brief terms with an identifier (e.g., "IBM").  Beyond the primary 
identifier, additional identifiers may be added as well and will work as 
'aliases'.  Any identifier will do – Bloomberg, Reuters-RIC, CUSIP, etc. – 
as long as it's unique to the workspace. In addition, a stock price will be 
denominated in a currency (e.g., "USD") and will have a specific tick size 
which is the minimum amount that the price can be quoted and transacted in 
(e.g., $0.01).  We also define a 'multiplier' that is used when calculating 
the notional value of a position or transaction using a quantity and price 
(sometimes called a contract multiplier).  For a stock it's usually '1'.
</p>
<p>More care is needed when dealing with complex instruments, like futures.  
First, we have to define a future as a root contract.  This root is not 
tradable unto itself, but is used to generate a series of futures which are 
tradable and expire through time.  The root contract will provide an 
identifier (e.g., 'C' for the CME's corn contract), a denomination currency, 
a multiplier (one futures contract will cover multiple items) and a minimum 
tick size.  From that definition, a series of expiring contracts can be 
generated ("C_H08", "C_Z08", etc.) by specifying a suffix to be associated 
with the series, usually something like 'Z9' or 'Mar10' denoting expiration 
and year.  As you might expect, options are treated similarly.  The package 
also includes constructors for certain synthetic instruments, such as 
spreads.
</p>
<p>FinancialInstrument doesn't try to exhaust the possibilities of attributes, 
so it instead allows for flexibility.  If you wanted to add an attribute to 
tag the exchange the instrument is listed on, just add it when defining the 
instrument (e.g., <code>future('CL', multiplier=1000, currency="USD", 
tick_size=.01, exchange="CME", description="Crude Light futures")</code>).  Or, as 
you can see, we've found it useful to add a field with more slightly more 
detail, such as <code>description='IBM Common Stock'</code>.  You can also add
attribute after the instrument has been created using 
<code>instrument_attr</code> as shown in the examples section below.
</p>
<p>Defining instruments can be tedious, so we've also included a CSV loader, 
<code>load.instruments</code>, in the package, as well as some functions
that will update instruments with data downloaded from the internet.
See, e.g., <code>update_instruments.yahoo</code>, 
<code>update_instruments.TTR</code>, 
<code>update_instruments.morningstar</code>,
<code>update_instruments.iShares</code>. You can also update an instrument
using the details of another one with 
<code>update_instruments.instrument</code> which can be useful for creating
a new future_series from an expiring one.
</p>
<p>Once you've defined all these instruments (we keep hundreds or thousands of 
them in our environments), you can save the instrument environment using
<code>saveInstruments</code>.  When you start a fresh R session, you 
can load your instrument definitions using <code>loadInstruments</code>.  We 
maintain an instrument.RData file that contains definitions for all 
instruments for which we have market data on disk.
</p>
<p>You may want to use <code>setSymbolLookup.FI</code> to define 
where and how your market data are stored so that 
<code>getSymbols</code> will work for you.
</p>
<p>FinancialInstrument's functions build and manipulate objects that are stored 
in an environment named ".instrument" at the top level of the package 
(i.e. "FinancialInstrument:::.instrument") rather than the global 
environment, <code>.GlobalEnv</code>.  Objects may be listed using 
<code>ls_instruments()</code> (or many other ls_* functions).
</p>
<p>We store instruments in their own environment for two reasons.  First, it 
keeps the user's workspace less cluttered and lowers the probability of 
clobbering something.  Second, it allows the user to save and re-use the 
<code>.instrument</code> environment in other workspaces.  Objects created with 
FinancialInstrument may be directly manipulated as any other object, but in 
our use so far we've found that it's relatively rare to do so.  Use the 
<code>getInstrument</code> function to query the contract specs of a 
particular instrument from the environment.

# Construct instruments for several different asset classes
# Define a currency and some stocks

## Compare instruments with all.equal.instrument method
all.equal(getInstrument("USD"), getInstrument("USD"))
all.equal(getInstrument("USD"), getInstrument("EUR"))
all.equal(getInstrument("SPY"), getInstrument("LQD"))

## Search for the tickers of instruments that contain words
find.instrument("computer") #IBM
find.instrument("bond")  #LQD

## Find only the ETFs; update_instruments.masterDATA added a "Fund.Type" field

    underlying_id=synthetic("SPX", "USD", src=list(src='yahoo', name='^GSPC')))

# above, in addition to defining the future root "ES", we defined an instrument 
# named "SPX".  Using the "src" argument causes setSymbolLookup to be called.
# Using the "src" arg as above is the same as 
# setSymbolLookup(SPX=list(src='yahoo', name='^GSPC'))
getSymbols("SPX") # this now works even though the Symbol used by 
                  # getSymbols.yahoo is "^GSPC", not "SPX"

## Back to the futures; we can define a future_series
future_series("ES_U2", identifiers=list(other="ESU2"))
# identifiers are not necessary, but they allow for the instrument to be found 
# by more than one name
getInstrument("ESU2") #this will find the instrument even though the primary_id 
                      #is "ES_U2"
# can also add indentifiers later
add.identifier("ES_U2", inhouse="ES_U12")

# can add an arbitrary field with instrument_attr
instrument_attr("ES_U2", "description", "S&amp;P 500 e-mini")
getInstrument("ES_U2")

option_series.yahoo("GS") # define a bunch of options on "GS"
# option root was automatically created
getInstrument(".GS")
# could also find ".GS" by looking for "GS", but specifiying type
