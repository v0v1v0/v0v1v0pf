<h2>Chocolate cake experiment with split plot design</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of recipe and baking
temperature on chocolate cake quality. 15 batches of cake mix for each
recipe were prepared. Each batch was sufficient for six cakes. Each of the
six cakes was baked at a different temperature which was randomly assigned.
Several measures of cake quality were recorded of which breaking angle was
just one.
