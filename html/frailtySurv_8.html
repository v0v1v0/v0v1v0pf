<h2>
Hard drive failure dataset
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains the observed follow-up times and SMART statistics of 52k unique hard drives.
</p>
<p>Daily snapshots of a large backup storage provider over 2 years were made publicly available. On each day, the Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) statistics of operational drives are recorded. When a hard drive is no longer operational, it is marked as a failure and removed from the subsequent daily snapshots. New hard drives are also continuously added to the population. In total, there are over 52k unique hard drives over approximately 2 years and 2885 (5.5%) failures.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("hdfail")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 52422 observations on the following 8 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>serial</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>unique serial number of the hard drive</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>model</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>hard drive model</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the observed followup time</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>status</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>failure indicator</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>temp</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>temperature in Celsius</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>rsc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>binary covariate, where 1 indicates sectors that encountered read, write, or verification errors</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>rer</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>binary covariate, where 1 indicates a non-zero rate of errors that occur in hardware when reading from data from disk.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>psc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>binary covariate, where 1 indicates there were sectors waiting to be remapped due to an unrecoverable error.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
