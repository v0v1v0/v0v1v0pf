<h2>resolve_duplicates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function for identifying and resolving alternative higher
assignments in a hierarchically structured dataframe.
Columns are checked from the lowest to the highest rank for
elements with multiple higher assignments. These assignments
are then assessed topologically to determine if they
represent inadvertent use of the same name at a given rank
for genuinely different entities, or whether the higher
classifications are conflicting. In the case of the former,
unique character suffixes are applied to each differently
classified case (up to 26 currently supported), effectively
splitting up the alternatively classified element. In the
case of the latter, the alternative classifications are
assessed and are either combined, or the more frequently
used or the more complete classification scheme is taken
(the more frequent pathway can also be the most complete).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">resolve_duplicates(x, ranks = NULL, jump = 4, plot = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe containing hierarchically structured
information, for example a table of genus names and their
higher taxonomic classifications</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ranks</code></td>
<td>
<p>If not NULL, a vector of column names of x,
given in rank order. This is useful if x contains columns
which are not rank relevant or if columns are not in
hierarchical order. If not supplied, the column order in x
is used directly and is assumed to be in rank order</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>jump</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of levels between the point of
divergence and the point of reunion (if present) for a given
path, below which the divergence will be taken as conflicting</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical speciying if the divergent paths should
be plotted</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical of length one which determines if
the function should report the detection and resolution of
elements with multiple higher classifications (if any)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The dataframe x, with any alternative higher
classifications resolved, giving the classification a strict
tree structure
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># load dataset
data("brachios")
# define ranks
b_ranks &lt;- c("phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus")
# run function
res &lt;- resolve_duplicates(brachios, ranks = b_ranks)
</code></pre>
