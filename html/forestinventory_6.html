<h2>forestinventory: A package for computing design-based estimates for multiphase forest inventories</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package provides <strong><em>global</em></strong>- and <strong><em>smallarea estimators</em></strong> for
<strong><em>twophase</em></strong> and <strong><em>threephase</em></strong> forest inventories under simple and
cluster sampling, which have been developed by Daniel Mandallaz at
ETH Zurich. The implemented methods have been published and applied in various studies
(see <code>References</code>) and can be used for <strong><em>double- and triple sampling for stratification</em></strong>,
<strong><em>double- and triple sampling for regression</em></strong> and <strong><em>double- and triple sampling for regression within strata</em></strong>.
</p>


<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>The package provides three main functions to apply the various estimators for
<em>twophase</em> and <em>threephase</em> forest inventories:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>twophase</code>    Function to apply global- and various smallarea estimation techniques for twophase inventories
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>threephase</code>  Function to apply global- and various smallarea estimation techniques for threephase inventories
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>onephase</code>    Function to apply estimations for onephase inventories,  mainly for comparison
with <code>two</code>-and <code>threephase</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The Motivation of writing this package was to provide an extensive and consistent
collection of state-of-the-art <em>design-based</em> estimation techniques for forest inventories.
It was especially designed to facilitate the application of the available estimators
in forest practice as well as in scientifically related studies. The work on this
package was also the trigger to complete the range of the already published estimators,
especially in the framework of three-phase smallarea estimators.
