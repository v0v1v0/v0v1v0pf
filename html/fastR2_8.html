<h2>Bugs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data frame contains data from an experiment to see if insects are more
attracted to some colors than to others. The researchers prepared colored
cards with a sticky substance so that insects that landed on them could not
escape. The cards were placed in a field of oats in July. Later the
researchers returned, collected the cards, and counted the number of cereal
leaf beetles trapped on each card.
