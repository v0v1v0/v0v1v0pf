<h2>
Classify favourability into 3 categories (low, intermediate, high)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a vector of <code>Fav</code>ourability values and reclassifies them into 3 increasing categories: low, intermediate or high. By default, the breaks between these classes are 0.2 and 0.8 (see Details), although these can be changed by the user.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">favClass(fav, breaks = c(0.2, 0.8), character = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fav</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of favourability values (obtained, e.g., with functions <code>Fav</code> or <code>multGLM</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>breaks</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of length 2 containing the two values which will divide <code>fav</code> into the 3 classes. Defaults to c(0.2, 0.8) following the literature (see Details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>character</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical value indicating whether the result should be returned in character rather numeric form. Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some applications of species distribution models imply setting a threshold to separate areas with high and low probability or favourability for occurrence (see, e.g., <code>bioThreat</code>). However, it makes little sense to establish as markedly different areas with, for example, 0.49 and 0.51 favourability values (Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 1989). It may thus be wiser to open a gap between values considered as clearly favourable and clearly unfavourable. When this option is taken in the literature, commonly used breaks are 0.8 as a threshold to classify highly favourable values, as the odds are more than 4:1 favourable to the species; 0.2 as a threshold below which to consider highly unfavourable values, as odds are less than 1:4; and classifying the remaining values as intermediate favourability (e.g., Munoz &amp; Real 2006, Olivero et al. 2016).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns either an integer or a character vector (following the 'character' argument, which is set to FALSE by default), of the same length as <code>fav</code>, reclassifying it into 3 categories: 1 ('low'), 2 ('intermediate'), or 3 ('high').
