<h2>Inserts a rule</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Adds a rule to a fis object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">addrule(fis, ruleList)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fis</code></td>
<td>
<p>A fis structure is to be provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ruleList</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of length m + n + 2, where m is the number of input variables of a fis. <br> Each column in 'm' has a number which refers to the membership function of that input variable. <br> Columns under 'n' refer to an output variable of a fis, where the value refers to the membership function of that output variable. <br> Finally, the '2' remaining columns refer to the weight to be applied to the rule (m + n + 1) and the fuzzy operator for the rule's antecedent (1 = AND, 2 = OR).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For example, if one has a fis with 2 input variables, and 1 output variable, each of which have 3 membership functions (the amount of membership functions need not be the same). The following rule: 1 3 2 1 2 will mean m = 2 (for 2 input variables), n = 1 (for 1 output variable), and the last 2 columns represent weight and fuzzy operator for the rule's antecedent respectively. <br><br>
The first column refers to the first input variable's membership function at index 1.<br><br>
The second column refers to the second input variable's membership function at index 3.<br><br>
The third column refers to the first output variable's membership function at index 2.<br><br>
The fourth column refers to the weight to be applied to the rule.<br><br>
The fifth column refers to the fuzzy operator for the rule's antecedent (in this case it represents 'OR').

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A fis structure with the new rule added.
