<h2>
Rotifer species on TDWG level 4 regions of the world
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data were extracted from a database of monogonont rotifer species records on the geographical units used by the Biodiversity Information Standards (formerly Taxonomic Database Working Group, TDWG: <a href="https://www.tdwg.org">https://www.tdwg.org</a>). The original data were compiled and published by Fontaneto et al. (2012) for all TDWG levels. Here they are reduced to the TDWG - level 4 units and to the species recorded in at least 100 (roughly one third) of these units. Mind that this is not a complete picture of these species' distributions, due to insufficient sampling in many regions.
