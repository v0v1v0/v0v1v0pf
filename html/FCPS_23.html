<h2>
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Matthews correlation coefficient eneralized to the multiclass case (a.k.a.  R_K statistic).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ClusterMCC(PriorCls, CurrentCls,Force=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PriorCls</code></td>
<td>

<p>Ground truth,[1:n] numerical vector with n numbers defining the classification. It has k unique numbers representing the labels of the clustering.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CurrentCls</code></td>
<td>

<p>Main output of the clustering, [1:n]  numerical vector with n numbers defining the classification. It has k unique numbers representing the labels of the clustering.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Force</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, if is TRUE: forces code even if one or more than one of the k numbers given in <code>PriorCls</code> is missing in <code>CurrentCls</code> or vice versa. In this case, one label per missing number is added ad the end of the vectors.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Contrary to accuracy, the MCC is balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes. When there are more than two labels the MCC will no longer range between -1 and +1. Instead the minimum value will be between -1 and 0 depending on the true distribution. The maximum value is always +1.
Beware that in contrast to <code>ClusterAccuracy</code>, the labels cannot be arbitrary. Instead each label of <code>PriorCls</code> and <code>CurrentCls</code> has to be mapped to the same cluster of data points. Typically this has to be ensured manually.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Single scalar of MCC in a range described in details.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If No. of Clusters is not equivalent, internally the number is allgined with zero datapoints belonging to the missing clusters.
