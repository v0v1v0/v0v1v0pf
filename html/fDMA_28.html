<h2>Plots Selected Outcomes from <code>fDMA</code> Function.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function plots selected outcomes from <code>fDMA</code>.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'dma'
plot(x,non.interactive=NULL, ...)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of <code>dma</code> class</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>non.interactive</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, <code>logical</code>, indicate whether plots should be made in non-interactive mode, by default <code>non.interactive=FALSE</code>, i.e., the user specifies in the interactive menu which plots will be made</p>
</td>
</tr>

<p>not used</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>x</code> comes from estimation of Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA), after executing the command, the User is asked to choose
</p>
<p>1 - for plotting actual and predicted values,
</p>
<p>2 - for plotting residuals,
</p>
<p>3 - for plotting the expected number of variables (including constant),
</p>
<p>4 - for plotting posterior inclusion probabilities (including constant) on one plot,
</p>
<p>5 - for plotting posterior inclusion probabilities (including constant) in separate png files, saved in the temporary directory, and moreover, to paste them into one big plot (also saved as a png file in the temporary directory),
</p>
<p>6 - for plotting expected coefficients (including constant) on one plot,
</p>
<p>7 - for plotting expected coefficients (including constant) in separate png files, saved in the temporary directory, and moreover, to paste them into one big plot (also saved as a png file in the temporary directory),
</p>
<p>8 - for plotting the expected value of <code>lambda</code>,
</p>
<p>9 - for plotting posterior model probabilities, if Dynamic Occam's Window method has not been selected, or plotting the number of models used in Dynamic Model Averaging, if Dynamic Occam's Window method has been selected.
</p>
<p>Chosing 0 exits the <code>plot</code> command.
</p>
<p>—————————————
</p>
<p>If x comes from estimation of Dynamic Model Selection (DMS) or Median Probability Model (MED), after executing <code>plot</code> the User is asked to choose
</p>
<p>1 - for plotting actual and predicted values,
</p>
<p>2 - for plotting residuals,
</p>
<p>3 - for plotting the expected number of variables (including constant),
</p>
<p>4 - for producing a plot showing which variables (including constant) are included in the DMS or MED model in each time,
</p>
<p>5 - for plotting expected coefficients (including constant) on one plot,
</p>
<p>6 - for plotting expected coefficients (including constant) in separate png files, saved in the temporary directory, and moreover, to paste them into one big plot (also saved as a png file in the temporary directory),
</p>
<p>7 - for plotting the expected value of <code>lambda</code> (only for DMS).
</p>
<p>Chosing 0 exits the <code>plot</code> command.
</p>
<p>If <code>non.interactive=TRUE</code> all the above plots are made.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Called for making a plot.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It is suggested to execute <code>graphics.off</code> before exectuing <code>plot</code> command for <code>dma</code> object. However, the User should take care to save all other plots before executing this command, as they can be lost.
</p>
<p>If <code>graphics.off</code> is not executed before plotting <code>dma</code> object, sometimes a legend might cover the important parts of the plot.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
wti &lt;- crudeoil[-1,1]
drivers &lt;- (lag(crudeoil[,-1],k=1))[-1,]
ld.wti &lt;- (diff(log(wti)))[-1,]
ld.drivers &lt;- (diff(log(drivers)))[-1,]

m1 &lt;- fDMA(y=ld.wti,x=ld.drivers,alpha=0.99,lambda=0.99,initvar=1,model="dma")
m2 &lt;- fDMA(y=ld.wti,x=ld.drivers,alpha=0.99,lambda=0.99,initvar=1,model="dms")

# graphics.off()
plot(m1)
# graphics.off()
plot(m2)
