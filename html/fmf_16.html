<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Forecasting skewed biased stochastic ozone days: analyses, solutions and beyond, Knowledge and Information Systems, Vol. 14, No. 3, 2008.
Discusses details about the dataset, its use as well as various experiments (both cross-validation and streaming) using many state-of-the-art methods.
</p>
<p>A shorter version of the paper (does not contain some detailed experiments as the journal paper above) is in:
Forecasting Skewed Biased Stochastic Ozone Days: Analyses and Solutions. ICDM 2006: 753-764 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(ozone)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2536 Instances and 73 attributes (including the class attribute, "Class": ozone day, normal day)
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following are specifications for several most important attributes 
that are highly valued by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). 
More details can be found in the two relevant papers.
</p>
<p>– O 3 - Local ozone peak prediction
– Upwind - Upwind ozone background level
– EmFactor - Precursor emissions related factor
– Tmax - Maximum temperature in degrees F
– Tb - Base temperature where net ozone production begins (50 F)
– SRd - Solar radiation total for the day
– WSa - Wind speed near sunrise (using 09-12 UTC forecast mode)
– WSp - Wind speed mid-day (using 15-21 UTC forecast mode)
