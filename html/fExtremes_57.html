<h3>1 Introduction</h3>

<p>The <code>fExtremes</code> package provides functions for analyzing
and modeling extreme events in financial time Series. The
topics include: (i) data pre-processing, (ii) explorative 
data analysis, (iii) peak over threshold modeling, (iv) block
maxima modeling, (v) estimation of VaR and CVaR, and (vi) the
computation of the extreme index.
</p>

like block maxima, and to decluster point process data.
</p>
<pre>
    blockMaxima     extracts block maxima from a vector or a time series 
    findThreshold   finds upper threshold for a given number of extremes
