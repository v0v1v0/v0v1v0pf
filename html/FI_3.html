<h3>Description</h3>

<p>That package was created because I can't find any free
solution for these basic calculations also will serve as
learning experience to create packages in R.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Here I implement the three basic volume equations
(Smalian, Newton, Huber) and form and stacking factors.
From these you can gather many information about a region
log volume (mean and standard deviation). Later a new
package will provide volumetric equations adjust.
