<h2>Control Sequence Aware Version of trimws</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removes any whitespace before the first and/or after the last non-<em>Control
Sequence</em> character.  Unlike with the <code>base::trimws</code>, only the default
<code>whitespace</code> specification is supported.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">trimws_ctl(
  x,
  which = c("both", "left", "right"),
  whitespace = "[ \t\r\n]",
  warn = getOption("fansi.warn", TRUE),
  term.cap = getOption("fansi.term.cap", dflt_term_cap()),
  ctl = "all",
  normalize = getOption("fansi.normalize", FALSE)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying whether to remove both
leading and trailing whitespace (default), or only leading
(<code>"left"</code>) or trailing (<code>"right"</code>).  Can be abbreviated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>whitespace</code></td>
<td>
<p>must be set to the default value, in the future it may
become possible to change this parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>warn</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE (default) or FALSE, whether to warn when potentially
problematic <em>Control Sequences</em> are encountered.  These could cause the
assumptions <code>fansi</code> makes about how strings are rendered on your display
to be incorrect, for example by moving the cursor (see <code>?fansi</code>).
At most one warning will be issued per element in each input vector.  Will
also warn about some badly encoded UTF-8 strings, but a lack of UTF-8
warnings is not a guarantee of correct encoding (use <code>validUTF8</code> for
that).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>term.cap</code></td>
<td>
<p>character a vector of the capabilities of the terminal, can
be any combination of "bright" (SGR codes 90-97, 100-107), "256" (SGR codes
starting with "38;5" or "48;5"), "truecolor" (SGR codes starting with
"38;2" or "48;2"), and "all". "all" behaves as it does for the <code>ctl</code>
parameter: "all" combined with any other value means all terminal
capabilities except that one.  <code>fansi</code> will warn if it encounters SGR codes
that exceed the terminal capabilities specified (see <code>term_cap_test</code>
for details).  In versions prior to 1.0, <code>fansi</code> would also skip exceeding
SGRs entirely instead of interpreting them.  You may add the string "old"
to any otherwise valid <code>term.cap</code> spec to restore the pre 1.0 behavior.
"old" will not interact with "all" the way other valid values for this
parameter do.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ctl</code></td>
<td>
<p>character, which <em>Control Sequences</em> should be treated
specially.  Special treatment is context dependent, and may include
detecting them and/or computing their display/character width as zero.  For
the SGR subset of the ANSI CSI sequences, and OSC hyperlinks, <code>fansi</code>
will also parse, interpret, and reapply the sequences as needed.  You can
modify whether a <em>Control Sequence</em> is treated specially with the <code>ctl</code>
parameter.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "nl": newlines.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "c0": all other "C0" control characters (i.e. 0x01-0x1f, 0x7F), except
for newlines and the actual ESC (0x1B) character.
</p>
</li>

above, in which case it means "all but".

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>normalize</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE or FALSE (default) whether SGR sequence should be
normalized out such that there is one distinct sequence for each SGR code.
normalized strings will occupy more space (e.g. "\033[31;42m" becomes
"\033[31m\033[42m"), but will work better with code that assumes each SGR
code will be in its own escape as <code>crayon</code> does.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The input with white space removed as described.
</p>


<h3>Control and Special Sequences</h3>

<p><em>Control Sequences</em> are non-printing characters or sequences of characters.
<em>Special Sequences</em> are a subset of the <em>Control Sequences</em>, and include CSI
SGR sequences which can be used to change rendered appearance of text, and
OSC hyperlinks.  See <code>fansi</code> for details.
</p>


<h3>Output Stability</h3>

<p>Several factors could affect the exact output produced by <code>fansi</code>
functions across versions of <code>fansi</code>, <code>R</code>, and/or across systems.
<strong>In general it is best not to rely on exact <code>fansi</code> output, e.g. by
embedding it in tests</strong>.
</p>
<p>Width and grapheme calculations depend on locale, Unicode database
version, and grapheme processing logic (which is still in development), among
other things.  For the most part <code>fansi</code> (currently) uses the internals of
<code>base::nchar(type='width')</code>, but there are exceptions and this may change in
the future.
</p>
<p>How a particular display format is encoded in <em>Control Sequences</em> is
not guaranteed to be stable across <code>fansi</code> versions.  Additionally, which
<em>Special Sequences</em> are re-encoded vs transcribed untouched may change.
In general we will strive to keep the rendered appearance stable.
</p>
<p>To maximize the odds of getting stable output set <code>normalize_state</code> to
<code>TRUE</code> and <code>type</code> to <code>"chars"</code> in functions that allow it, and
set <code>term.cap</code> to a specific set of capabilities.
</p>
