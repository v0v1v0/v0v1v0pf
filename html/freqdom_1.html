<h2>Frequency domain basde analysis: dynamic PCA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implementation of dynamic principle component analysis (DPCA),
simulation of VAR and VMA processes and frequency domain tools.
The package also provides a toolset for developers simplifying
construction of new frequency domain based methods for multivariate signals.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">freqdom</span> package allows you to manipulate time series objects
in both time and frequency domains. We implement dynamic principal component analysis methods,
enabling spectral decomposition of a stationary vector time series into uncorrelated components.
</p>
<p>Dynamic principal component analysis enables estimation of temporal filters which
transform a vector time series into another vector time series with uncorrelated components,
maximizing the long run variance explained.
There are two key differnces between classical PCA and dynamic PCA:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Components returned by the dynamic procedure are uncorrelated in time, i.e. for any <code class="reqn">i \neq j</code>
and <code class="reqn">l \in Z</code>, <code class="reqn">Y_i(t)</code> and <code class="reqn">Y_j(t_l)</code> are uncorrelated,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The mapping maximizes the long run variance, which, in case of stationary vector time series, means
that the process reconstructed from and <code class="reqn">d &gt; 0</code> first dynamic principal components
better approximates your vector time series process than the first <code class="reqn">d</code> classic principal components.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For details, please refer to literature below and to help pages of functions <code>dpca</code>
for estimating the components, <code>dpca.scores</code> for estimating scores and
<code>dpca.KLexpansion</code> for retrieving the signal from components.
</p>
<p>Apart from frequency domain techniques for stationary vector time series,
<span class="pkg">freqdom</span> provides a toolset of operators such as the vector Fourier Transform
(<code>fourier.transform</code>) or a vector spectral density operator
(<code>spectral.density</code>) as well as simulation of vector time series
models <code>rar</code>, <code>rma</code> generating vector
autoregressive and moving average respectively.
These functions enable developing new techniques based on the Frequency domain analysis.
