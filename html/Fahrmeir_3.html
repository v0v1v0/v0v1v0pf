<h2> Cellular Differentiation   </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The effect of two agents of immuno-activating ability that may induce cell
differentiation was investigated. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(cells)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 16 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>y</dt>
<dd>
<p>number of cells differentiating</p>
</dd>
<dt>TNF</dt>
<dd>
<p>dose of TNF, U/ml</p>
</dd>
<dt>IFN</dt>
<dd>
<p>dose of IFN, U/ml</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The effect of two agents of immuno-activating ability that may induce cell
differentiation was investigated.  As response variable the number of
cells that exhibited markers after exposure was recorded. It is of interest
if the agents TNF (tumor necrosis factor) and IFN (interferon)
stimulate cell differentiation independently, or if there is a synergetic
effect.  200 cells were examined at each dose combination.
