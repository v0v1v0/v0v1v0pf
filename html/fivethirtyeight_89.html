<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">partisan_lean_district
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataset with 435 rows representing votes and 4 variables
</p>

<dl>
<dt>state</dt>
<dd>
<p>the state of the vote</p>
</dd>
<dt>district_number</dt>
<dd>
<p>the district_number of the vote</p>
</dd>
<dt>pvi_party</dt>
<dd>
<p>the party of the vote</p>
</dd>
<dt>pvi_amount</dt>
<dd>
<p>the Cook Partisan Voting Index of the vote</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The original dataset only has 2 columns: "district" and "pvi_538". I separated each of the 2 columns into two.
For example, in row 1 of the dataset, the original "district" = "AK-1", and I separated it into "state" = "Arkansas" and "district_number" = "1";
the original "pvi_538" = "R+15.21", and I separated it into â€œpvi_party" = "R" and "pvi_amount" = "15.21".
In addition, I used the full names for all states instead of abbreviations.
