<h2>Mean time to final state in a mixture multi-state model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the mean time from the start of the process to a final (or
"absorbing") state in a mixture multi-state model.  Models with cycles are
not supported.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">meanfinal_fmixmsm(x, newdata = NULL, final = FALSE, B = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Object returned by <code>fmixmsm</code>, representing a multi-state
model built from piecing together mixture models fitted by
<code>flexsurvmix</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame or list of covariate values.   If omitted for a
model with covariates, a default is used, defined by all combinations of
factors if the only covariates in the model are factors, or all covariate
values of zero if there are any non-factor covariates in the model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>final</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> then the mean time to the final state is
calculated for each final state, by taking a weighted average of the mean
time to travel each pathway ending in that final state, weighted by the
probability of the pathway.   If <code>FALSE</code>  (the default) then a
separate mean is calculated for each pathway.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of simulations to use to compute 95% confidence intervals,
based on the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the basic
parameter estimates.  If <code>B=NULL</code> then intervals are not computed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame of mean times to absorption, by covariate values and
pathway (or by final state)
