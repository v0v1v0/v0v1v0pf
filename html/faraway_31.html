<h2>Crawling babies by month</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A study investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold
months when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement,
than in warmer months. The study sought an association between babies' first
crawling age and the average temperature during the month they first try to
crawl (about 6 months after birth). Parents brought their babies into the
University of Denver Infant Study Center between 1988-1991 for the study.
The parents reported the birth month and age at which their child was first
able to creep or crawl a distance of four feet in one minute.  Data were
collected on 208 boys and 206 girls (40 pairs of which were twins)
