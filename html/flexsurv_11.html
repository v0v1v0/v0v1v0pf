<h2>Check the fit of Markov flexible parametric multi-state models against
nonparametric estimates.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes both parametric and comparable Aalen-Johansen nonparametric
estimates from a flexible parametric multi-state model, and returns them
together in a tidy data frame.  Only models with no covariates, or only
factor covariates, are supported.  If there are factor covariates, then the
nonparametric estimates are computed for subgroups defined by combinations
of the covariates.  Another restriction of this function is that all
transitions must have the same covariates on them.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ajfit_fmsm(x, maxt = NULL, newdata = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Object returned by <code>fmsm</code> representing a flexible
parametric multi-state model.  This must be Markov, rather than
semi-Markov, and no check is performed for this.   Note that all
"competing risks" style models, with just one source state and multiple
destination states, are Markov, so those are fine here.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxt</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum time to compute parametric estimates to.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame defining the subgroups to consider.  This must
have a column for each covariate in the model.  If omitted, then all
potential subgroups defined by combinations of factor covariates are
included.  Continuous covariates are not supported.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Tidy data frame containing both Aalen-Johansen and parametric
estimates of state occupancy over time, and by subgroup if subgroups are
included.
