<h2>
Utilities for fast spatial prediction. 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Based on a stationary Gaussian process model these functions support fast prediction onto
a grid using a sparse matrix approximation. They also allow for fast 
prediction to off-grid values (aka interpoltation) from an equally spaced rectangular grid and  using a spatial model. The sparsity comes about because only a fixed number of neighboring grid points
(NNSize) are used in the prediction.  The prediction variance for off-grid location is also give in the returned object. These function are used as the basis for approximate conditional simulation for large
spatial datasets asnd also for fast spatial prediction from irregular locations onto a grid.
</p>

<p>If TRUE the prediction variances (via the Kriging
model and assumed covariance function) for the offgrid locations are
found. If FALSE just the prediction weights are returned. This option is a bit faster. 
This switch only is implemented for the 2 D case since the extra  computational demands for 1 D are modest.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>offGridWeights</strong> This function creates the interpolation weights taking advantage of some
efficiency in the covariance function being stationary, use
of a fixed configuration of nearest neighbors, and Kriging
predictions from a rectangular grid. 
</p>
<p>The returned matrix is in spam sparse matrix format. See
example below for the "one-liner" to make the prediction
once the weights are computed. Although created primarily
for (approximate) conditional simulation of a spatial process this
function is also useful for interpolating to off grid
locations from a rectangular field. It is also used for
fast, but approximate prediction for Kriging with a
stationary covariance. 
</p>
<p>The function <code>offGridWeights</code> is a simple wrapper to
call either the 1D or 2D functions 
</p>
<p>In most cases one would not use these approximations for a 1D problem.
However,
the 1D algorithm is included as a separate function for testing and also
because this is easier to read and understand the conversion between the
Kriging weights for each point and the sparse matrix encoding of them.
</p>
<p>The interpolation errors are also computed based on the nearest neighbor
predictions. This is returned as a sparse matrix in the component SE. 
If all observations are in different grid boxes then <code>SE</code> is
diagonal
and agrees with the square root of the component
<code>predctionVariance</code> but
if multiple observations are in the same grid box then SE has blocks of
upper
triangular matrices that can be used to simulate the prediction error
dependence among observations in the same grid box. 
Explicitly if <code>obj</code> is the output object and there are <code>nObs</code>
observations then 
</p>
<pre>error &lt;- obj$SE%*% rnorm( nObs)</pre> 
<p>will simulate a prediction error that includes the dependence. Note that
in
the case that there all observations are in separate grid boxes this code line is the same as 
</p>
<pre>error &lt;- sqrt(obj$predictionVariance)*rnorm( nObs)</pre>
<p>It is always true that the prediction variance is given by 
<code> diag( obj$SE%*% t( obj$SE))</code>.
</p>
<p>The user is also referred to the testing scripts
<code>offGridWeights.test.R</code>  and 
<code>offGridWeights.testNEW.R</code>in <code>tests</code> where the 
Kriging predictions and standard errors are computed explicitly and 
tested against the sparse
matrix computation. This is helpful in defining exactly what
is being computed. 
</p>
<p>Returned value below pertains to the offGridWeights function. 
</p>
<p><strong>addMarginsGridList</strong> This is a supporting function that adds 
extra grid points for a gridList so that every irregular point has a
complete number of nearest neighbors.
</p>
<p><strong>findGridBox</strong>This is a handy function that finds the indices of
the lower left grid box that contains the points in <code>s</code>. If the
point is not contained within the range of the grid and NA is returned 
fo the index. 
This function assumes that the grid points are equally spaced.</p>
