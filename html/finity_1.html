<h2>
Test for Finiteness of Moments in a Distribution
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this package is to tests whether a given 
             moment of the distribution of a given sample is finite or not. For 
             heavy-tailed distributions with tail exponent b, only moments of 
             order smaller than b are finite. Tail exponent and heavy-
             tailedness are notoriously difficult to ascertain. But the 
             finiteness of moments (including fractional moments) can be tested 
             directly. This package does that following the test suggested by 
             Trapani (2016) &lt;doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.08.006&gt;.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main function of the package, which performs the test for the finiteness of moments, is 
</p>
<p>finite_moment_test().
</p>
<p>The test assumes a sample drawn from an unknown distrubution <code class="reqn">F</code>. Given this sample, the finiteness or infiniteness of any moment of  order <code class="reqn">k</code> of distribution <code class="reqn">F</code> can be ascertained. For this, the test follows a randomised testing procedure with artificial randomness. The absolute sample moment <code class="reqn">\mu_k</code> of the desired order <code class="reqn">k</code> of the sample is transformed into a test statistic,  which follows a <code class="reqn">\chi^2</code> distribution with one degree of freedom exactly if the moment of the same order <code class="reqn">k</code> of <code class="reqn">F</code> is not finite. The null hypothesis in the test is that the moment is infinite; the alternative is that it is finite.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that while the moment of order <code class="reqn">k</code> of <code class="reqn">F</code> may be infinite, the sample moment <code class="reqn">\mu_k</code> is always finite because the sample is of finite size. The sample moment will, however, diverge with growing sample size if the moment of the same order <code class="reqn">k</code> of the original distribution <code class="reqn">F</code> is not finite.
</p>
<p>The test works as follows: A standard normal distribution is rescaled with <code class="reqn">\sqrt{\exp(\mu_k)}</code>, yielding a normal distribution with mean 0 and either finite or infinite variance, depending on whether the hypothesis holds. For every observation of the resulting distribution, it is then tested, if the observation is located within an interval <code class="reqn">[-u, u]</code>. The resulting binary quantity <code class="reqn">\zeta</code> (0, or 1, true or false) follows a Bernoulli distribution with mean 1/2 exactly if the <code class="reqn">k</code>th moment of <code class="reqn">F</code> is infinite. Otherwise the mean is not 1/2. Sampling a number of different intervals characterized by different bounds <code class="reqn">u</code> drawn from a distribution with finite support, the test aggregates over quantities <code class="reqn">\zeta</code> such that the resulting test statistic follows a <code class="reqn">\chi^2</code> exactly if <code class="reqn">E(\zeta)=1/2</code>, i.e., if the <code class="reqn">k</code>th moment of <code class="reqn">F</code> is infinite.
</p>
<p>Trapani (2016) offers some insights into the performance of the test and the impact its parameters have. These parameters are optional arguments of the testing function finite_moment_test().
