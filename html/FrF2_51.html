<h2> Function to provide regular Fractional Factorial 2-level designs </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Regular fractional factorial 2-level designs are provided. 
Apart from obtaining the usual minimum aberration designs in a fixed number of runs, it is possible to 
request highest number of free 2-factor interactions instead of minimum aberration or to 
request the smallest design that fulfills certain requirements (e.g. resolution V with 8 factors).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nruns</code></td>
<td>
<p> Number of runs, must be a power of 2 (4 to 4096), if given. 
</p>
<p>The number of runs can also be omitted. In that case, 
if <code>resolution</code> is specified, the function looks for the smallest 
design of the requested resolution that accomodates <code>nfactors</code> factors. 
If the smallest possible design is a full factorial or not catalogued, 
the function stops with an error.
</p>
<p>If <code>generators</code> is specified, <code>nruns</code> is required.
</p>
<p>If estimable is specified and <code>nruns</code> omitted, 
<code>nruns</code> becomes the size of the smallest design that 
MIGHT accomodate the effects requested in <code>estimable</code>. 
If this run size turns out to be too low, an error is thrown. 
In that case, explicitly choose <code>nruns</code> as twice the run size 
given in the error message and retry. </p>
</td>

<td><code>nfactors</code></td>

<p> is the number of 2-level factors to be investigated. 
It can be omitted, if it is obvious from <code>factor.names</code>, 
a specific catalogued design given in <code>design</code>, 
<code>nruns</code> together with <code>generators</code>, or 
<code>estimable</code>. 
</p>
<p>If <code>estimable</code> is used for determining 
the number of factors, it is assumed that the largest main effect position number 
occurring in <code>estimable</code> coincides with <code>nfactors</code>. 
</p>
<p>For blocked designs, block generator columns are not included in 
<code>nfactors</code>, except if 
the user explicitly specifies 2-level block generation factors as 
part of the fractional factorial design (e.g. a factor shift with levels 
morning and afternoon). 
</p>
<p>For automatically-generated split-plot designs (cf. details section), 
<code>nfactors</code> simply is the number of all factors (whole plot and split plot together). 
If <code>nfac.WP &lt; log2(WPs)</code>, the algorithm will add (an) artificial plot generation factor(s). 
<br>
For manually-specified split-plot designs (through options <code>generators</code> or 
<code>design</code> together with <code>WPfacs</code>), the user must specify at least <code>log2(WPs)</code> 
split plot factors, i.e. <code>nfac.WP &gt;= log2(WPs)</code> is required (and must, if necessary, 
be achieved by adding <code>log2(WPs) - nfac.WP</code> extra independent generator columns 
for the whole plot structure, which have to be counted in <code>nfac.WP</code> and <code>nfactors</code>).</p>

<td><code>generators</code></td>

The generators specify how the remaining factors

</p>
<p><code>generators</code> can be 
</p>
<p>a list of vectors with position numbers of base factors (e.g. c(1,3,4) 
stands for the interaction between first, third and fourth base factor) 
</p>
<p>a vector of character representations of these interactions, 
e.g. “ACD” stands for the same interaction as above
</p>
<p>a vector of columns numbers in Yates order (e.g. 13 stands for ACD). 
Note that the columns 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., i.e. all powers of 2, are reserved 
for the base factors and cannot be used for assigning additional factors, 
because the design would become a resolution II design. For looking up 
which column number stands for which interaction, type e.g. 
<code>names(Yates)[1:15]</code> for a 16 run design.
</p>
<p>In all cases, preceding the respective entry with a minus sign 
(e.g. -c(1,3,4), “-ACD”, -13) implies that the levels

variation generated by such a procedure will be too small, so that average values 
should be analyzed for an unreplicated design. 
</p>
<p>Otherwise (default), the full experiment is first carried out once, then 
for the second replication and so forth. In case of randomization,

The default is 10 - if not satisfied with the structure of the whole plot 
factors, a larger choice might help find a better design (but also take 
longer run time). </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Per default, the function picks the best design from the 
default design catalogue <code>catlg</code> (a list object of class <code>catlg</code>). 
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the user can explicitly specify a design through accessing 
a specific catalogued design using the <code>design</code> option or specifying non-catalogued 
generators via the <code>generators</code> option.
</p>
<p>Apart from generation of simple fractional factorial designs based on catalogued 
or non-catalogued generators, function <code>FrF2</code> allows specification of blocked designs 
and split-plot designs, as well as specification of a set of 2fis that are required to be estimable. 
The implementation of these possibilities is explained in the separate help files <code>block</code>, 
<code>splitplot</code> and <code>estimable.2fis</code>. If you consider to use 
option <code>hard</code>, it may also be worth while to look at the <code>splitplot</code> 
help file.
</p>
<p>Function <code>FrF2</code> is still under development, although most features are 
now included, and the principle structure of inputs and outputs should not change 
much any more. Please contact me with any suggestions for improvements.
</p>
<p>Function <code>FrF2.currentlychecked</code> is meant as a diagnostic tool, 
when searching for designs with option <code>estimable</code>
and <code>clear=TRUE</code>. If the search takes very long, it can be interrupted 
(CAUTION: in some igraph versions, interrupting the search may crash R). 
After a successful interruption, and <code>FrF2.currentlychecked()</code> 
returns a character string with the name of the design that was checked at the 
time of interruption. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function <code>FrF2</code> returns a data frame of S3 class <code>design</code> 
that has attached attributes that can be accessed 
by functions <code>desnum</code>, 
<code>run.order</code> and 
<code>design.info</code>. 
</p>
<p>The data frame itself contains the design with levels coded as requested. 
If no center points have been requested, the design columns are factors with 
contrasts <code>-1</code> and <code>+1</code> (cf. also <code>contr.FrF2</code>); in case 
of center points, the design columns are numeric.
</p>
<p>The following attributes are attached to it: 
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>desnum</code></td>
<td>
<p>Design matrix in -1/1 coding</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>run.order</code></td>
<td>
<p>a three column data frame;<br> 
the first column (<code>run.no.in.std.order</code>)
contains the run number in standard order, possibly including a block number 
and in that case also a number for the original position within the block,<br> 
the second column (<code>run.no</code>) contains the actual run number as randomized, <br>
the third column contains (<code>run.no.std.rp</code>) contains the content 
of the first column accumulated with a replication identifier, if applicable.<br>
A few remarks on the run number in standard order are needed here: <br>
In blocked and split plot designs, the run number in standard 
order refers to a row ordering with the first base factor changing <em>slowest</em>, 
different from the usual order with the first base factor changing <em>fastest</em>. 
Also note that the run number in standard order may not refer to 
the base columns one would naturally expect for designs created with blocking,  
estimable 2fis or split plot designs; the elements <code>map</code> and/or  
<code>orig.fac.order</code> of the attribute <code>design.info</code> help identify 
which base factors drive the run number in standard order.
(In case of option <code>hard=TRUE</code>, the remark on split plot designs applies, 
and the numbering refers to the special slow change matrix from 
Cheng et al. 1998.)<br>
Before version 2 of package FrF2, blocking for large situations was internally 
done with function <code>blockpick.big</code>. This behavior can be reproduced 
using the argument <code>block.old=TRUE</code>; if blocking for a large design is 
not successful otherwise, <code>block.old=TRUE</code> might be worth a try. 
For blocked designs created internally with 
function <code>blockpick.big</code>, 
the run number in standard order is not easily related to the final 
design.</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Since R version 3.6.0, the behavior of function <code>sample</code> has changed 
(correction of a biased previous behavior that should not be relevant for the randomization of designs). 
For reproducing a randomized design that was produced with an earlier R version, 
please follow the steps described with the argument <code>seed</code>.
