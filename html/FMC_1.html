<h2>FMC: A package for constructing minimallly changed run sequences
in factorial experiments</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The FMC package can be used to construct run sequences with minimum
changes in factor levels. Experimenter can save time and resources by
minimizing the number of changes in levels of individual facor
and therefore the total number of changes. The package provides the function minimal.factorial and gen.level.
This technique can be employed to any symmetric or asymmetric
factorial combination.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In Design of Experiments (DOE) theory, levels of a factor
can be represented as integers e.g. -1 for low, 0 for medium and
1 for high. This representation helps in studying factors with high
number of levels. The function "gen.level()" provides the same
representation for any factor with given number of total levels.
User is expected to enter a vector of total number of levels for
each factor to be considered in the experiment. Function
"minimal.factorial()" provides the required run sequences for the
input vector of level totals. The output also gives the number
of changes of each factor along with total number of changes
in the run sequence.

<h3>FMC functions</h3>

<p>gen.level: Generate integers representing the levels of a factor. <br>
minimal.factorial: Generate minimally changed runs for asymmetric
and symmetric factorial combinations.. <br></p>
