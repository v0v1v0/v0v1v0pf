<code>"ZADEH"</code>, <code>"GOGUEN"</code>, <code>"GODEL"</code>, <code>"SHARP"</code>, <code>"MIZUMOTO"</code>, 
<code>"DUBOIS_PRADE"</code>, and <code>"MIN"</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The names of linguistic terms of the input variables: These names are generated
automatically by frbs expressing all linguistic terms considered. Generally,
these names are built by two parts which are the name of variables expressed 
by <code>"v"</code> and the name of linguistic terms of each variables represented by <code>"a"</code>. 
For example, <code>"v.1_a.1"</code> means the linguistic value <code>"a.1"</code> of the first variable (v.1).
However, we provide different format if we set the number of linguistic terms (<code>num.labels</code>) to 3, 5, 7. 
For example, for the number of label 3, it will be <code>"small"</code>, <code>"medium"</code>, and <code>"large"</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The names of linguistic terms of the output variable: For the Mamdani model, since the frbs package only considers
single output, the names of the linguistic terms for the output variable 
are simple and clear and start with <code>"c"</code>. However, for the Takagi Sugeno Kang model and
fuzzy rule-based classification systems, this component is always <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The parameter values of membership functions of the input variables (normalized):
It is represented by a matrix (<code class="reqn">5 \times n</code>) where n depends on the number of 
linguistic terms on the input variables and the first row of the matrix describes 
a type of membership function, and the rest of rows are 
their parameter values. 
For example, label <code>"v.1_a.2"</code> has value 
4.0, 0.23, 0.43, 0.53, 0.73 on its column. It means that the label a.2 of variable v.1 
has a parameter as follows. 
4.0 on the first row shows <code>TRAPEZOID</code> shape in the middle position, 
while 0.23, 0.43, 0.53, and 0.73 are corner points of a <code>TRAPEZOID</code>. 
Furthermore, the following is the complete list of shapes of membership functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>TRIANGLE</code>: 1 on the first row and rows 2, 3, and 4 represent corner points. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>TRAPEZOID</code>: 2, 3, or 4 on the first row means they are <code>TRAPEZOID</code> in left, right and middle side, respectively,
and rows 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent corner points. But for <code>TRAPEZOID</code> at left or right side the fifth row is <code>NA</code>. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>GAUSSIAN</code>: 5 on the first row means it uses <code>GAUSSIAN</code> and second and third row represent mean and variance.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>SIGMOID</code>: 6 on the first row and two parameters (gamma and c) on second and third rows.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>BELL</code>: 7 on the first row and three parameters (a, b, c) on second, third, and fourth rows.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> The fuzzy IF-THEN rules: In this package, there are several models for representing
fuzzy IF-THEN rules based on the method used. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> the Mamdani model: they are represented as a knowledge base containing two parts: 
antecedent and consequent parts which are separated by a sign "THEN", as for example in the
following rule:
</p>
<p><code>IF var.1 is v.1_a.1 and var.2 is v.2_a.2 THEN var.3 is c.2</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the Takagi Sugeno Kang model: In this model, this component only represents the antecedent
of rules while the consequent part will be represented by linear equations. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> fuzzy rule-based classification systems (FRBCS): This model is quite similar to the Takagi Sugeno Kang model,
but the consequent part expresses pre-defined classes instead of a simplify of linear equations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> approximate approach: Especially for <code>GFS.FR.MOGUL</code>, a matrix of parameters
of membership functions is used to represent the fuzzy IF-THEN rules as well.  
The representation of rules and membership functions is a matrix (<code class="reqn">n \times (p \times m)</code>) where
n is the number of rules and m is the number of variables while p is the number of corner points 
of the membership function, if we are using <code>TRIANGLE</code> or <code>TRAPEZOID</code> then p = 3 or 4, respectively. 
For example, let us consider the triangular membership function and a number of variables of 3. 
The representation of rules and membership functions is as follows:
</p>
<p><code>&lt;&lt;a11 a12 a13&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;b11 b12 b13&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;c11 c12 c13&gt;&gt;</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> The linear equations on consequent parts of fuzzy IF-THEN rules: It is used in
the Takagi Sugeno Kang model.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The weight of the rules or the certainty factor: For the <code>FRBCS.W</code> method, this shows the weight related to the rules 
representing the ratio of dominance among the rules.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The cluster centers: This component is used in clustering methods representing cluster centers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
