<h2>Calculate baseflow peak statistics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function finds the start, middle, end, and duration of the baseflow
peak based on percent of the total annual baseflow volume.
A value of 0 is returned for years with no flow. Hydrologic 
years with fewer than normal observations (outliers) are excluded from the 
analysis, and for stations with seasonal flow records, additional seasonal 
subsetting is done to include only days with observations in all years.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pk.bf.stats(TS, bfpct = c(25, 50, 75))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TS</code></td>
<td>
<p>output from <code>create.ts</code> containing a data.frame of flow
time series</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bfpct</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of percentages used to define the 
start, middle, and end of the baseflow peak. Default is c(25, 50, 75)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates metrics intended to focus on snowmelt-related
streamflow occuring in spring and summer. For catchments in cold climates, 
the baseflow peak can be interpreted as snowmelt-induced. Baseflow is estimated with 
<code>bf_eckhardt</code>. If total annual flow is equal to 0, returns NA for that
year.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data.frame with the following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Start - day of year defining the start of the baseflow peak
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Mid - day of year defining the middle of the baseflow peak
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> End - day of year defining the end of the baseflow peak
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Dur - duration of the baseflow peak, in days
</p>
</li>
</ul>
