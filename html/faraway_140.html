<h2>Toenail infection treatment study</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data come from a Multicenter study comparing two oral treatments for
toenail infection. Patients were evaluated for the degree of separation of
the nail. Patients were randomized into two treatments and were followed
over seven visits - four in the first year and yearly thereafter. The
patients have not been treated prior to the first visit so this should be
regarded as the baseline.
