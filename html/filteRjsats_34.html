<h2>Four Hit Filter for Lotek Detections</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a Lotek detection dataframe generated from the add_fish()
function and filters it a second time to remove any remaining multipath
detections, and then check the remaining detections by comparing the time
between detections, for a rolling window of 4 detections to ensure it is less
16.6x the stated pulse rate interval. It additionally checks that all
detections within the window occur within 20% of the pulse rate interval of
the other detections and that the standard deviation of pulse rate intervals
is less than 0.025. Called by second_filter().
</p>
