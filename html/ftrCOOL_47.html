<h2>Di riboNucleotide To Binary RNA (DiNUC2Binary_RNA)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function transforms a di-ribonucleotide to a binary number with four bits which is enough to represent all the possible types of di-ribonucleotides.
The type of the binary format is determined by the binaryType parameter.
For details about each format, please refer to the description of the binaryType parameter.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DiNUC2Binary_RNA(
  seqs,
  binaryType = "numBin",
  outFormat = "mat",
  outputFileDist = "",
  label = c()
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seqs</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a FASTA file containing ribonucleotide sequences. The sequences start
with '&gt;'. Also, seqs could be a string vector. Each element of the vector is a ribonucleotide sequence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>binaryType</code></td>
<td>
<p>It can take any of the following values: ('strBin','logicBin','numBin').
'strBin' (String binary): each di-ribonucleotide is represented by a string containing 4 characters(0-1). For example, AA = "0000"   AC="0001"   ...  TT="1111"
'logicBin' (logical value): Each di-ribonucleotide is represented by a vector containing 4 logical entries. For example, AA = c(F,F,F,F)   AC=c(F,F,F,T)  ...    TT=c(T,T,T,T)
'numBin' (numeric bin): Each di-ribonucleotide is represented by a numeric (i.e., integer) vector containing 4 numeric entries. For example, AA = c(0,0,0,0)   AC = c(0,0,0,1)  ...  TT = c(1,1,1,1)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outFormat</code></td>
<td>
<p>(output format) can take two values: 'mat'(matrix) and 'txt'. The default value is 'mat'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outputFileDist</code></td>
<td>
<p>shows the path and name of the 'txt' output file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>label</code></td>
<td>
<p>is an optional parameter. It is a vector whose length is equivalent to the number of sequences. It shows the class of
each entry (i.e., sequence).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output is different depending on the outFormat parameter ('mat' or 'txt').
If outFormat is set to 'mat', it returns a feature matrix for sequences with the same lengths.
The number of rows is equal to the number of sequences and if binaryType is 'strBin', the number of columns is (length of the sequences-1).
Otherwise, it is equal to (length of the sequences-1)*4.
If outFormat is 'txt', all binary values will be written to a 'txt' file. Each line in the file shows the binary format of a sequence.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function is provided for sequences with the same lengths.
Users can use 'txt' option in outFormat for sequences with different lengths.
Warning: If outFormat is set to 'mat' for sequences with different lengths, it returns an error.
Also, when output format is 'txt', label information is not shown in the text file.
It is noteworthy that 'txt' format is not usable for machine learning purposes if sequences have different sizes. Otherwise 'txt' format
is also usable for machine learning purposes.

<h3>Examples</h3>

mat&lt;-DiNUC2Binary_RNA(seqs = fileLNC, binaryType="numBin",outFormat="mat")
