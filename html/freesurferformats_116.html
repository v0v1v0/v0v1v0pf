<h2>Read FreeSurfer ASCII format patch.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An ASCII format patch is a part of a brain surface mesh, and is a mesh itself. It consists of vertices and faces. The ASCII patch format is very similar to the ASCII surface format. **Note:** The contents of ASCII and binary patch format files is different. The ASCII patch format is not ideal for parsing, and loading such files is currently quite slow.
