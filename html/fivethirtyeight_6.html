<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Eliminates connote either an elimination (starts with "E") or a rose
(starts with "R"). Eliminations supersede roses. "E" connotes a standard
elimination, typically at a rose ceremony. "EQ" means the contestant quits.
"EF" means the contestant was fired by production. "ED" connotes a date
elimination. "EU" connotes an unscheduled elimination, one that takes place
at a time outside of a date or rose ceremony. "R" means the contestant
received a rose. "R1" means the contestant got a first impression rose.
"D1" means a one-on-one date, "D2" means a 2-on-1, "D3" means a 3-on-1
group date, and so on. Weeks of the show are eliminated by rose
ceremonies, and may not line up exactly with episodes.
