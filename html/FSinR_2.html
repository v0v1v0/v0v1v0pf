<h2>Binary consistency measure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates an evaluation function that calculates the binary consistency, also known as "Sufficiency test" from FOCUS (Almuallim and Dietterich 1991) (set measure). This function is called internally within the <code>filterEvaluator</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">binaryConsistency()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a function that is used to generate an evaluation set measure using the binary consistency value for the selected features.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run:  

## The direct application of this function is an advanced use that consists of using this 
# function directly to evaluate a set of features
## Classification problem

# A discrete dataset is used (in this case we use only several discrete columns)
adult &lt;- adult[,c(4,9,10,15)]

# Generate the evaluation function with Binary Consistency
bc_evaluator &lt;- binaryConsistency()
# Evaluate the features (parameters: dataset, target variable and features)
bc_evaluator(adult,'income',c('race','sex','education'))

## End(Not run)
