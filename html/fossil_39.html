<h2>Function to Find Local Optimization for clustering</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function meant to be used internally be the <code>relational.clustering</code> function
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">localoptima(dist, group)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance matrix to be used</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>group designations</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function takes a distance matrix and a vector with the group identifications for each sample locality (or equivalent). It is mainly meant to be used internally by the <code>relational.clustering</code> function to optimize the initial clustering and find the local (which hopefully is also the global) optimal organization, such that each member of a group is more similar to the other members in it's group (on average) than to any other groups.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Arc distance between two points on the Earth's surface in kilometers.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The distance calculated may be up to 0.2% inaccurate, as this function 
treats the Earth as a sphere with a circumference of 40003 km, rather than an
ellipsoid like it actually is.
