<h2>Support for emmeans package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>If <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> is installed, its functionality is supported for <code>fixest</code>
or <code>fixest_multi</code> objects. Its reference grid is based on the main part
of the model, and does not include fixed effects or instrumental variables.
Note that any desired arguments to <code>vcov()</code> may be passed as optional
arguments in <code>emmeans::emmeans()</code> or <code>emmeans::ref_grid()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>When fixed effects are present, estimated marginal means (EMMs) are estimated
correctly, provided equal weighting is used. However, the SEs of these EMMs
will be incorrect - often dramatically - because the estimated variance of
the intercept is not available. However, <em>contrasts</em> among EMMs can be
estimated and tested with no issues, because these do not involve the
intercept.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">if(requireNamespace("emmeans") &amp;&amp; requireNamespace("AER")) {
    data(Fatalities, package = "AER")
    Fatalities$frate = with(Fatalities, fatal/pop * 10000)
    fat.mod = feols(frate ~ breath * jail * beertax | state + year, data = Fatalities)
    emm = emmeans::emmeans(fat.mod, ~ breath*jail, cluster = ~ state + year)
    emm   ### SEs and CIs are incorrect

    emmeans::contrast(emm, "consec", by = "breath")   ### results are reliable
}
</code></pre>
