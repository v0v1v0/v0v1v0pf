<h2>Fast Robust Moments.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fast, numerically robust moments computations, along with computation of
cumulants, running means, etc.
</p>


<h3>Robust Moments</h3>

<p>Welford described a method for 'robust' one-pass computation of the
standard deviation. By 'robust', we mean robust to round-off caused
by a large shift in the mean. This method was generalized by Terriberry,
and Bennett <em>et. al.</em> to the case of higher-order moments. 
This package provides those algorithms for computing moments.
</p>
<p>Generally we should find that the stock implementations of <code>sd</code>,
<code>skewness</code> and so on are <em>already</em> robust and likely using
these algorithms under the hood. This package was written for a few
reasons:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> As an exercise to learn Rcpp.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Often I found I needed the first <code class="reqn">k</code> moments. For example,
when computing the Z-score, the standard deviation and mean must be
computed separately, which is inefficient. Similarly Merten's correction
for the standard error of the Sharpe ratio uses the first four moments.
These are all computed as a side effect of computation of the kurtosis,
but discarded by the standard methods.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The moment computations provided by fromo are 
numerically robust, but will often <em>not</em> provide the
same results as the 'standard' implementations,
due to differences in roundoff. We make every attempt to balance
speed and robustness. User assumes all risk from using
the fromo package.

<p>This package was developed as an exercise in learning Rcpp.
