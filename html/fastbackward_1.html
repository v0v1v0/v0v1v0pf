<h2>Performs Fast Backward Elimination by AIC</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs backward elimination by AIC, backward elimination is
performed with a bounding algorithm to make it faster.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fastbackward(
  object,
  scope,
  scale = 0,
  trace = 1,
  keep = NULL,
  steps = 1000,
  k = 2,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object representing a model of an appropriate class. This is
used as the initial model in the stepwise search.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scope</code></td>
<td>
<p>defines the range of models examined in the stepwise search. This
should be missing or a single formula. If a formula is included, all of the
components on the right-hand-side of the formula are always included in the model.
If missing, then only the intercept (if included) is always included in the model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>used in the definition of the AIC statistic for selecting the models,
currently only for lm and aov models (see extractAIC for details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trace</code></td>
<td>
<p>if positive, information is printed during the running of <code>fastbackward</code>.
Larger values may give more detailed information. If <code>trace</code> is greater than 1, then
information about which variables at each step are not considered for removal due
to the bounding algorithm are printed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep</code></td>
<td>
<p>a filter function whose input is a fitted model object and the associated <code>AIC</code> statistic,
and whose output is arbitrary. Typically <code>keep</code> will select a subset of the components
of the object and return them. The default is not to keep anything.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>steps</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum number of steps to be considered. The default is 1000
(essentially as many as required). It is typically used to stop the process early.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>the multiple of the number of degrees of freedom used for the penalty.
Only <code>k = 2</code> gives the genuine AIC: <code>k = log(n)</code> is sometimes referred to as BIC or SBC.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>any additional arguments to extractAIC.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The bounding algorithm allows us to avoid fitting models that cannot possibly
provide an improvement in AIC. At a high-level, the algorithm basically
works by identifying important predictors whose removal from the current model
cannot possibly improve upon the current AIC.
</p>
<p>Test statistics, p-values, and confidence intervals from the final selected
model are not reliable due to the selection process. Thus, it is not recommended
to use these quantities.
</p>
<p>See more details at MASS::stepAIC.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The stepwise-selected model is returned, with up to two additional components.
There is an "<code>anova</code>" component corresponding to the steps taken in the search,
as well as a "<code>keep</code>" component if the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠keep=⁠</code> argument was supplied in the call.
The "<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠Resid. Dev⁠</code>" column of the analysis of deviance table refers to a constant
minus twice the maximized log likelihood: it will be a deviance only in cases
where a saturated model is well-defined (thus excluding <code>lm</code>, <code>aov</code> and <code>survreg</code> fits,
for example)
