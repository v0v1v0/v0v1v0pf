<h2>Flea beetles dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data were collected on the genus of flea beetle <em>Chaetocnema</em>, which contains three species:
<em>concinna</em>, <em>heikertingeri</em>, and <em>heptapotamica</em>.
Measurements were made on the width and angle of the aedeagus of each beetle.
The goal of the original study was to form a classification rule to distinguish the three species.
