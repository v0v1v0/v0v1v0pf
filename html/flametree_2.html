<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Generative art created with flametree is a visualisation of a data
structure created by calling <code>flametree_grow()</code>. The underlying
algorithm is an iterative branching process: each tree starts out as a single
vertical segment, to which multiple new segments are added at the end of the
first iteration. Over multiple iterations this creates a tree-like structure.
</p>
<p>The user can control how this iterative process unfolds. By setting the
<code>seed</code> argument the random number generator is reset using
<code>set.seed()</code>. The <code>trees</code> argument specifies the number of trees
to create using this process, the <code>time</code> argument specifies how many
iterations of the branching process will be run (at least two), and the
<code>split</code> argument specifies how many new segments (at least two) will be
created each time abranching occurs.
</p>
<p>When a new segment is created, its size and orientation are controlled by the
<code>scale</code> and <code>angle</code> arguments. The <code>scale</code> argument takes a
vector of at least two positive numbers. One of these numbers is selected at
random whenever a new segment is created, and the length of the new segment
is equal to the length of the "parent" segment from which it was created,
multiplied by this scaling factor. The orientation of the new segment is
controlled by the angle argument in an analogous way. Every time a new
segment is generated, one of these angles (interpreted in degrees, not
radians) is selected at random. The orientation of the new segment is equal
to the orientation of the parent segment plus the sampled angle. Like the
<code>scale</code> argument, <code>angle</code> must contain at least two values.
</p>
<p>The remaining arguments (<code>seg_col</code>, <code>seg_wid</code>, <code>shift_x</code>,
and <code>shift_y</code>) all take functions as their input, and are used to
control how the colours (<code>seg_col</code>) and width (<code>seg_wid</code>) of the
segments are created, as well as the horizontal (<code>shift_x</code>) and
vertical (<code>shift_y</code>) displacement of the trees are generated. Functions
passed to these arguments take four inputs: <code>coord_x</code>, <code>coord_y</code>,
<code>id_tree</code>, and <code>id_time</code>. Any function that takes
these variables as input can be used for this purpose. However, as a
convenience, four "spark" functions are provided that can be used to create
functions that are suitable for this purpose: <code>spark_linear()</code>,
<code>spark_decay()</code>, <code>spark_random()</code>, and <code>spark_nothing()</code>.
</p>
<p>These functions are documented in their own help files. To give an example,
the default behaviour of <code>flametree_grow()</code> adds a random horizontal
displacement to each tree to give the impression of multiple trees growing
side by side. To suppress this horizontal displacement, set
<code>shift_x = spark_nothing()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output of <code>flametree_grow()</code>' is a tibble with the following
columns: <code>coord_x</code>, <code>coord_y</code>, <code>id_tree</code>, <code>id_time</code>,
<code>id_path</code>, <code>id_leaf</code>, <code>id_pathtree</code>, <code>id_step</code>,
<code>seg_deg</code>, <code>seg_len</code>, <code>seg_col</code>, and <code>seg_wid</code>. Each
row in the tibble specifies a single point: every curved segment is defined
by three such rows.
</p>
<p>The two "coord" columns are numeric variables that specify the location of
the point itself. The "id" columns are used as indicators of various kinds.
The <code>id_tree</code> column contains numbers specifying which tree each point
belongs to, and similarly the <code>id_time</code> column is a numeric identifier
that specifies the time point at which the point was generated (i.e., the
iteration of the generative process). The <code>id_step</code> column contains
a number (0, 1, or 2) indicating whether the point is the first point, the
midpoint, or the end point of the relevant curved segment in a tree. In
addition, there are two identifier columns used to denote the segments
themselves. The <code>id_path</code> column is numeric, and assigns value 1 to
the "first" segment (i.e., the lowest part of the tree trunk) for every
tree, with values increasing numerically for each subsequent segment. Values
for <code>id_path</code> will uniquely identify a segment within a tree, but when
multiple trees are generated there will be multiple segments that have the
same <code>id_path</code> value. If a unique identifier across trees is needed,
use the <code>id_pathtree</code> column, which is a character vector constructed
by pasting the <code>id_path</code> and <code>id_tree</code> values into a string, with
an underscore as the separator character.
</p>
<p>In addition to the two coordinate columns and the six identifier columns,
the data generated by <code>flametree_grow()</code> contains four "seg" columns
that are intended to map onto different visual characteristics of a plot.
The <code>seg_deg</code> column specifies the orientation of the segment, whereas
<code>seg_len</code> denotes the length of the segment, <code>seg_col</code> specifies
the colour (as a numeric value that could be interpreted by a palette), and
<code>seg_wid</code> specifies the width of the segment. Note that this information
use used differently by the <code>flametree_plot()</code> function, depending on
what style of plot is generated.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># flametree data structure with default parameters
flametree_grow()

# setting time = 10 runs the generative process
# longer resulting in a table with more rows
flametree_grow(time = 10)

# default behaviour is to randomly displace trees
# by random horizontal perturbation: to switch this
# off use the spark_nothing() function
flametree_grow(shift_x = spark_nothing())

</code></pre>
