<h2>Effects of surface and vision on balance.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment was conducted to study the effects of surface and vision on
balance. The balance of subjects were observed for two different surfaces
and for restricted and unrestricted vision. Balance was assessed
qualitatively on an ordinal four-point scale based on observation by the
experimenter. Forty subjects were studied, twenty males and twenty females
ranging in age from 18 to 38, with heights given in cm and weights in kg.
The subjects were tested while standing on foam or a normal surface and with
their eyes closed or open or with a dome placed over their head.  Each
subject was tested twice in each of the surface and eye combinations for a
total of 12 measures per subject.
