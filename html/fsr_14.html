<h2>Add fuzzy rules to an FSI model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>fsi_add_rules()</code> adds the fuzzy rules set to a fuzzy spatial inference (FSI) model.
A fuzzy rule must contain only linguistic variables and values included in the antecedent parts and consequent.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fsi_add_rules(fsi, rules, weights = rep(1, length(rules)))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fsi</code></td>
<td>
<p>An FSI model instantiated with the <code>fsi_create()</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rules</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector containing the rules defined by the user. It follows a specific format, as detailed below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of weight values for each rule. Default values are 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>fsi_add_rules()</code> function adds fuzzy rules to an FSI model.
The definition of a fuzzy rule is user-friendly since users can write it by using the <em>linguistic variables</em> and <em>linguistic values</em> previously defined and added to the FSI model (via <code>fsi_add_fsa()</code> and <code>fsi_add_cs()</code>).
</p>
<p>A fuzzy rule has the format <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠IF A THEN B⁠</code>, where <code>A</code> is called the antecedent and <code>B</code> the consequent of the rule such that <code>A</code> implies <code>B</code>.
Further, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are statements that combine fuzzy propositions by using logical connectives like <code>AND</code> or <code>OR</code>.
Each fuzzy proposition has the format <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠LVar is LVal⁠</code> where <code>LVal</code> is a linguistic value in the scope of the linguistic variable <code>LVar</code>.
</p>
<p>To avoid possible contradictions keep in mind the following items when specifying the rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> the order of the statements in the antecedent is not relevant.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> each linguistic variable has to appear at most one time in each fuzzy rule.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> only one kind of logical connective (i.e., <code>AND</code> or <code>OR</code>) must be used in the statements of the antecedent.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An FSI model populated with a fuzzy rules set.
