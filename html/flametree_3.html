<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>flametree_plot()</code> function provides several ways to
visualise the data created by the generative system implemented by
<code>flametree_grow()</code>. The <code>background</code> argument sets the background
colour of the image, and should either be a string specifying an RGB hex
colour (e.g., "#000000") or the of a colour recognised by R (see the
<code>colours()</code> function for details). Analogously, the <code>palette</code>
argument should be a vector of colours. However, the <code>palette</code> argument
is  interpreted slightly differently depending on which style of plot is
created, discussed below. To set the <code>style</code> of the resulting plot,
pass one of the following style names: "plain" (the default), "voronoi",
"wisp", "nativeflora", "minimal", or "themegray".
</p>
<p>Plots in the "plain" style have the following properties. Branches of
the trees vary in width using the <code>seg_wid</code> data column. Each branch
is shown as a curved segment created using <code>geom_bezier2()</code>, and the
colour of the segments is mapped to the <code>seg_col</code> column in the data.
No leaves are drawn. In this style, the elements of the <code>palette</code> are
used to create a continuous n-colour gradient using
<code>scale_colour_gradientn()</code>.
</p>
<p>Plots in the "voronoi" style draw the shape of the tree the same way as
the plain style, except that the segments do not vary in colour and are
rendered using <code>geom_bezier()</code> instead of <code>geom_bezier2()</code>. Unlike
the plain style, stylised "leaves" are drawn by constructing a Voronoi
tesselation of the terminal nodes in the tree. Note that computing the
tesselation is computationally expensive and this will likely produce
errors if there are too many nodes (typically when the <code>time</code> parameter
to <code>flametree_grow()</code> is large). The interpretation of the
<code>palette</code> argument is slightly different: the first element of the
palette is used to set the colour of the trees, and the rest of the palette
colours are used to create the gradient palette used to colour the tiles
depicted in the Voronoi tesselation.
</p>
<p>The <code>style = "nativeflora"</code> style creates a plot in which tree branches
are rendered as thin segments, with a proportion of those segments removed,
and small points are drawn at the end of each terminal segment. The width of
the branches does not vary (i.e., <code>seg_wid</code> is ignored) and the colour
of the branches is constant within tree, but does vary across trees, ignoring
the continuous valued <code>seg_col</code> variable and using only the
<code>id_tree</code> variable to do so. As with the plain style, the
<code>palette</code> colours are used to define an n-colour gradient.
</p>
<p>The "wisp" style is similar to nativeflora, but no segments are removed, and
the wdith of the branches is mapped to <code>seg_wid</code>. It only uses the first
two elements of <code>palette</code>: the first element specifies the colour of the
branches, and the second element specifies the colour of the leaf dots.
</p>
<p>The final two styles are simplifications of other styles. The "minimal"
style is similar to the plain style but does not use curved segments, relying
on <code>geom_path()</code> to draw the branches. The "themegray" style does this
too, but it ignores the <code>palette</code> argument entirely, rendering the trees
in black, set against the default gray background specified by the ggplot2
<code>theme_gray()</code> function.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ggplot object.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># the default tree in the plain style
flametree_grow() %&gt;% flametree_plot()

# 10 trees drawn in the nativeflora style
flametree_grow(trees = 10, shift_x = spark_nothing()) %&gt;%
  flametree_plot(style = "nativeflora")

# changing the palette
shades &lt;- c("#A06AB4", "#FFD743", "#07BB9C", "#D773A2")
flametree_grow() %&gt;% flametree_plot(palette = shades)

</code></pre>
