<h2>Variable importance table</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A vimpTable object contains information concerning variable importance of one
or more features. These objects are created during feature selection.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>vimpTable objects exists in various states. These states are
generally incremental, i.e. one cannot turn a declustered table into the
initial version. Some methods such as aggregation internally do some state
reshuffling.
</p>
<p>This object replaces the ad-hoc lists with information that were used in
versions prior to familiar 1.2.0.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>vimp_table</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Table containing features with corresponding scores.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>vimp_method</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Method used to compute variable importance scores for each
feature.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>run_table</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run table for the data used to compute variable importances
from. Used internally.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>score_aggregation</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Method used to aggregate the score of contrasts for
each categorical feature, if any,</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>encoding_table</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Table used to relate categorical features to their
contrasts, if any. Not used for all variable importance methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cluster_table</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Table used to relate original features with features
after clustering. Variable importance is determined after feature
processing, which includes clustering.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>invert</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Determines whether increasing score corresponds to increasing
(<code>FALSE</code>) or decreasing rank (<code>TRUE</code>). Used internally to determine how
ranks should be formed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>project_id</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Identifier of the project that generated the vimpTable
object.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>familiar_version</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Version of the familiar package used to create this
table.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>state</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>State of the variable importance table. The object can have the
following states:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>initial</code>: initial state, directly after the variable importance table is
filled.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>decoded</code>: depending on the variable importance method, the initial
variable importance table may contain the scores of individual contrasts
for categorical variables. When decoded, data in the <code>encoding_table</code>
attribute has been used to aggregate scores from all contrasts into a
single score for each feature.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>declustered</code>: variable importance is determined from fully processed
features, which includes clustering. This means that a single feature in
the variable importance table may represent multiple original features.
When a variable importance table has been declustered, all clusters have
been turned into their constituent features.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>reclustered</code>: When the table is reclustered, features are replaced by
their respective clusters. This is actually used when updating the cluster
table to ensure it fits to a local context. This prevents issues when
attempting to aggregate or apply variable importance tables in data with
different feature preprocessing, and as a result, different clusters.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ranked</code>: The scores have been used to create ranks, with lower ranks
indicating better features.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>aggregated</code>: Score and ranks from multiple variable importance tables
were aggregated.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
