<h2>Wear on materials according to type, run and position</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>abrasion</code> data frame has 16 rows and 4 columns.  Four materials
were fed into a wear testing machine and the amount of wear recorded. Four
samples could be processed at the same time and the position of these
samples may be important.  A Latin square design was used.
</p>
