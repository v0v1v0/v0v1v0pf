<h2> Function to generate non-regular fractional factorial screening designs </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function generates Plackett-Burman designs and in some cases other screening 
designs in run numbers that are a multiple of 4. These designs are particularly suitable for screening a 
large number of factors, since interactions are not fully aliased with one main effect each 
but partially aliased. (The design in 8 runs is an exception from this rule.)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pb(nruns, nfactors = nruns - 1, factor.names = if (nfactors &lt;= 50) 
     Letters[1:nfactors] else paste("F", 1:nfactors, sep = ""), 
     default.levels = c(-1, 1), ncenter=0, center.distribute=NULL, 
     boxtyssedal = TRUE, n12.taguchi = FALSE, 
     replications = 1, repeat.only = FALSE, 
     randomize = TRUE, seed = NULL, oldver = FALSE, ...)

pb.list

<p> number of runs, must be a multiple of 4 </p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nfactors</code></td>
<td>
<p> number of factors, default is nruns - 1, 
and it is recommended to retain this default.<br> 
It is possible to specify factor names for fewer factors, 
and the remaining columns will be named <code>e1</code>, <code>e2</code>, ... 
They are useful for representing error in effects plots 
(so-called dummy factors). </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>factor.names</code></td>
<td>
<p> a character vector of factor names (length up to nfactors) 
or a list with <code>nfactors</code> elements;<br> 
if the list is named, list names represent factor names, otherwise default factor names are used;<br> 
the elements of the list are <br>
EITHER vectors of length 2 with factor levels for the respective factor<br>
OR empty strings. 
For each factor with an empty string in factor.names, the levels given in 
<code>default.levels</code> are used;<br>
Default factor names are the first elements of the character vector <code>Letters</code>, 
or the factors position numbers preceded by capital F in case of more than 50 factors. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>default.levels</code></td>
<td>
<p> default levels (vector of length 2) for all factors for which no specific levels are given </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncenter</code></td>
<td>
<p> number of center points; <code>ncenter &gt; 0</code> 
is permitted, if all factors are quantitative </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>center.distribute</code></td>
<td>
<p> the number of positions over which the center points 
are to be distributed ; if NULL (default), center points are 
distributed over end, beginning, and middle (in that order, if there are fewer than three center points) 
for randomized designs, and appended to the end for non-randomized designs. 
for more detail, see function <code>add.center</code>, which does the work.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>boxtyssedal</code></td>
<td>
<p> logical, relevant only for nruns=16. 
If FALSE, the geometric (=standard) 16 run plan is used. 
If TRUE, the proposal by Box and Tyssedal is used instead, which has the advantage (for screening) of aliasing each interaction with several main effects, like the other Plackett-Burman designs. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n12.taguchi</code></td>
<td>
<p> logical, relevant only for nruns=12. If TRUE, the 12 run design is given in Taguchi order. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replications</code></td>
<td>
<p> positive integer number. Default 1 (i.e. each row just once). 
If larger, each design run is executed replication times. 
If <code>repeat.only</code>, repeated measurements 
are carried out directly in sequence, i.e. no true replication takes place, 
and all the repeat runs are conducted together. It is likely that the error 
variation generated by such a procedure will be too small, so that average values 
should be analyzed for an unreplicated design. 
</p>
<p>Otherwise (default), the full experiment is first carried out once, then 
for the second replication and so forth. In case of randomization, 
each such blocks is randomized separately. In this case, replication variance is 
more likely suitable for usage as error variance 
(unless e.g. the same parts are used for replication runs although build 
variation is important). </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>repeat.only</code></td>
<td>
<p> logical, relevant only if replications &gt; 1. If TRUE, 
replications of each run are grouped together 
(repeated measurement rather than true replication). The default is 
<code>repeat.only=FALSE</code>, i.e. the complete experiment 
is conducted in <code>replications</code> blocks, and each run occurs in each block. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>randomize</code></td>
<td>
<p> logical. If TRUE, the design is randomized. This is the default. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p> optional seed for the randomization process <br>
In R version 3.6.0 and later, the default behavior of function <code>sample</code>
has changed. If you work in a new (i.e., &gt;= 3.6.-0) R version and want to reproduce 
a randomized design from an earlier R version (before 3.6.0), 
you have to change the RNGkind setting by<br><code>RNGkind(sample.kind="Rounding")</code><br>
before running function <code>pb</code>.<br>
It is recommended to change the setting back to the new recommended way afterwards:<br><code>RNGkind(sample.kind="default")</code><br>
For an example, see the documentation of the example data set <code>VSGFS</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>oldver</code></td>
<td>
<p> logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, the column ordering from 
package versions 1.0-5 to 1.2.10 is used. This affects designs in 
40, 52, 56, 64, 76, 92, 96 and 100 runs. 
Usually, option <code>oldver</code> should not be set to is useful for reproducing an 
old design, or for making a design in 40, 56, 64, 88 or 96 runs with 
exactly half the number of factors resolution IV.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>pb</code> stands for Plackett-Burman. Plackett-Burman designs (Plackett and Burman 1946) are generally 
used for screening many variables in relatively few runs, when interest is in 
main effects only, at least initially. Different from the regular 
fractional factorial designs created by function <code>FrF2</code>, they 
do not perfectly confound interaction terms with main effects but distribute 
interaction effects over several main effects. The designs with number of runs 
a power of 2 are an exception to this rule: they are just the resolution III 
regular fractional factorial designs and are as such not very suitable for 
screening because of a high risk of very biased estimates for the main effects 
of the factors. Where possible, these are therefore replaced by different designs (cf. below).
</p>
<p>For most run numbers, function <code>pb</code> uses Plackett-Burman designs, 
and simply fills columns from left to right. 
The generating rows for these designs can be found in the list <code>pb.list</code> 
(a 0 entry indicates that the design is constructed by a different method, e.g. doubling).
</p>
<p>For 12 runs, the isomorphic design by Taguchi can be requested. 
For 16 runs, the default is to use the designs suggested by Box and Tyssedal (2001), 
which up to 14 factors do not suffer from perfect aliasing. 
For 32 runs, a cyclic design with generating row given in Samset and Tyssedal (1999) is used. 
For 64 runs, the 32 run design is doubled.
For 92 runs, a design is constructed according to the Williamson construction with matrices A, B, C and D from Hedayat and Stufken (1999), p. 160. 
</p>
<p>Designs up to 100~runs are covered. 
</p>
<p>Usage of the 8 run design for more than 4 factors is discouraged, 
as it completely aliases main effects with individual two-factor interactions. 
It is recommended to use at least the 12 run design instead for screening more than 4 factors. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Value is a data frame of S3 class <code>design</code> 
and has attached attributes that can be accessed 
by functions <code>desnum</code>, 
<code>run.order</code> and 
<code>design.info</code>. 
</p>
<p>The data frame itself contains the design with levels coded as requested. 
If no center points have been requested, the design columns are factors with 
contrasts <code>-1</code> and <code>+1</code> (cf. also <code>contr.FrF2</code>); in case 
of center points, the design columns are numeric.
</p>
<p>The following attributes are attached to it:

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>With version 1.0-5 of package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>, 
design generation for the designs based on doubling has changed (internal function 
<code>double.des</code>). This affected designs for 40,56,64,88,96 runs. 
With version 1.3 of package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>, this and further behaviors (52, 76) has changed 
again, in the interest of improving generalized resolution of desigs produced by function <code>pb</code>. 
</p>
<p>For the affected run sizes, package versions from 1.0-5 onwards 
cannot exactly reproduce pb designs that have been created with a version before 
1.0-5. Package versions from 1.3 onwards reproduce the behavior of versions 1.0-5 to 1.2-10 
through option <code>oldver</code>.</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Since R version 3.6.0, the behavior of function <code>sample</code> has changed 
(correction of a biased previous behavior that should not be relevant for the randomization of designs). 
For reproducing a randomized design that was produced with an earlier R version, 
please follow the steps described with the argument <code>seed</code>.
