Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Toronto Alexithymia Scale is the most utilized measure of alexithymia in empirical research and is composed of <code class="reqn">d = 20</code> items that can be subdivided into <code class="reqn">G = 3</code> non-overlapping groups: <code class="reqn">d_1 = 7</code> items to assess difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), <code class="reqn">d_2 = 5</code> items to assess difficulty describing feelings (DDF) and <code class="reqn">d_3 = 8</code> items to assess externally oriented thinking (EOT).
Students were 17 to 25 years old and 58% of them were female and 42% were male. They were asked to respond to each item using one of K = 5 categories: “1 = completely disagree”, “2 = disagree”, “3 = neutral”, “4 = agree”, “5 = completely agree”.
