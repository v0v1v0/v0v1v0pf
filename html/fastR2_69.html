<h2>Dwindling soap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A bar of soap was weighed after showering to see how much soap was used each
shower.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 15 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>
 
<dl>
<dt>date</dt>
<dd> </dd> 
<dt>day</dt>
<dd>
<p> days since start of soap
usage and data collection</p>
</dd> 
<dt>weight</dt>
<dd>
<p> weight of bar of soap (in
grams) </p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>According to Rex Boggs:
</p>
<p>I had a hypothesis that the daily weight of my bar of soap [in grams] in my
shower wasn't a linear function, the reason being that the tiny little bar
of soap at the end of its life seemed to hang around for just about ever. I
wanted to throw it out, but I felt I shouldn't do so until it became
unusable. And that seemed to take weeks.
</p>
<p>Also I had recently bought some digital kitchen scales and felt I needed to
use them to justify the cost. I hypothesized that the daily weight of a bar
of soap might be dependent upon surface area, and hence would be a quadratic
function ... .
</p>
<p>The data ends at day 22. On day 23 the soap broke into two pieces and one
piece went down the plughole.
