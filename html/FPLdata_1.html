<h2>Read in Fantasy Premier League Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read in the weekly-updated Fantasy Premier League football data from the
GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/andrewl776/fplmodels">fplmodels</a>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">FPLdata()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data contains a large variety of information on players and their
current attributes on
<a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/">Fantasy Premier League</a>. In particular, it contains a
next_gw_points (next gameweek points) value for each player given their
attributes in the current week. Rows represent player-gameweeks, i.e. for
each player there is a row for each gameweek. This makes the data suitable
for modelling a player's next gameweek points, given attributes such as
form, total points, and cost at the current gameweek. This data can
therefore be used to create Fantasy Premier League bots that may use a
machine learning algorithm and a linear programming solver (for example)
to return the best possible transfers and team to pick for each gameweek,
thereby fully automating the decision making process in Fantasy Premier
League. This function simply supplies the required data for such a task.
