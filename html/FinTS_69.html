<h3>Format</h3>


<dl>
<dt>m.ibmsp2699ln</dt>
<dd>
<p>zoo object giving monthly simple and log returns of IBM stock and
the Standard and Poor's 500 from 1926 through 1999.  (This
combines files 'm-ibmsp2699.txt' and 'm-ibmspln.txt' from the
book's web site.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>m.bnd</dt>
<dd>
<p>zoo object giving the monthly simple returns of 30, 20, 10, 5 and
1 year maturity bonds from 1942 through 1999.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>m.gs1n3.5301</dt>
<dd>
<p>zoo object giving 1 and 3 year US Treasury constant maturity
interest rates from April 1953 to January 2001 (used in Example
8.6, pp. 373ff).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>w.tb3n6ms</dt>
<dd>
<p>zoo object giving weekly 3 and 6 month US Treasury Bill interest
rates from 1958-12-12 to 2004-08-06 (used in Sect. 8.6.5,
pp. 385ff).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>sp5may</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data.frame of 7061 observations on 4 variables based on
minute-by-minute observations of the Standard and Poor's 500
Futures and prices in May 1993.
</p>
<p>These data are used, after some processing, in Tsay(Sect. 8.7.2,
pp. 392ff).  Unfortunately, it's not yet clear what these numbers
are.  The following is a current guess and will doubtless change
in the future.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>logFuture</dt>
<dd>
<p>logarithms of June Futures contracts traded at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.  The first difference of this series
appears to be plotted in Figure 8.16(a), after replacing '10
extreme values (5 on each side) by the simple average of their
two nearest neighbors.' (p. 392)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>logPrice</dt>
<dd>
<p>logarithms of Standard and Poor's 500 price levels.  The first
differences of this series appears to be plotted in Figure
8.16(b), after adjustment similar to that for 'logFuture'.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>dailyAvgSomething</dt>
<dd>
<p>numbers that assume 19 distinct levels separated by 18
discrete jumps.  The name of this will likely change whenever
more information about it can be obtained for this
documentation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>day</dt>
<dd>
<p>index for the 19 distinct levels assumed by
'dailyAvgSomething'.  This is probably the trading day in May
1993.  However, there appear to have been 20 trading days in
that month, so if these 19 levels do correspond to trading
days, it's not clear which date is missing.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These data were analyzed by Forbes, Kalb, and Kofman (1999);
Tsay (1998) was also referenced with the discussion of the
analysis of these data.
