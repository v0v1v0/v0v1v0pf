<h2>Sample dataset for funreg</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame generated using the following code:
<code>set.seed(123);
       SampleFunregData &lt;- generate.data.for.demonstration(nsub = 200,  
                                                           b0.true = -5,
                                                           b1.true = 0, 
                                                           b2.true = +1,
                                                           b3.true = -1,
                                                           b4.true = +1,
                                                           nobs = 400, 
                                                           observe.rate = 0.1);</code>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame for a simulated longitudinal study, 
in "tall" rather than "wide" format (multiple rows per
individual, one for each measurement time)
with 8109 rows and 13 columns.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Integer uniquely identifying the subject to whom this data row pertains.</p>
</dd>
<dt>s1,s2,s3,s4</dt>
<dd>
<p>Four subject-level (time-invariant) covariates.</p>
</dd>
<dt>y</dt>
<dd>
<p>A response, coded as 0 or 1, which is to be modeled 
using a functional regression.  It is also subject-level (i.e., 
either time-invariant or measured only once).  However, 
like <code>s1</code> through <code>s4</code>, its value is repeated for each 
row of data for a subject.</p>
</dd>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time variable, arbitrarily chosen to range
from a low of 0 to a high of 10, which identifies when this row's 
observations are taken.</p>
</dd>
<dt>true.x1,true.x2</dt>
<dd>
<p>The unknown smooth expected values of two
time-varying variables which can be treated as functional covariates. They
vary by subject and time and are therefore different in each row.</p>
</dd>
<dt>true.betafn1,true.betafn2</dt>
<dd>
<p>The unknown true functional
regression coefficient function used to generate <code>y</code> from the two time-varying 
predictors.  The latter is always zero because x2 is unrelated to y.</p>
</dd>
<dt>x1,x2</dt>
<dd>
<p>The observed values of the two functional regression
predictors, as measured for a given time on a given subject.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
