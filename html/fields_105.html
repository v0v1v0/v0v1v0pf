Response surface experiment ionizing a reagent 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The characteristics of an ionizing flame are varied with the intent of 
maximizing the intensity of emitted light for lithuim in 
solution. Areas outside of the measurements are where the mixture may 
explode! Note that the optimum is close to the boundary. Source of data is 
from a master's level lab experiment in 
analytical chemistry from Chuck Boss's course at NCSU. 
&lt;s-section name= "DATA DESCRIPTION"&gt;
