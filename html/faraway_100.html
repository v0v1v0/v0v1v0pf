<h2>NIST data on ultrasonic measurements of defects in the Alaska pipeline</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Researchers at National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST)
collected data on ultrasonic measurements of the depths of defects in the
Alaska pipeline in the field. The depth of the defects were then remeasured
in the laboratory. These measurements were performed in six different
batches. The laboratory measurements are more accurate than the in-field
measurements, but more time consuming and expensive.
