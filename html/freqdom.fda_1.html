<h2>Functional time series: dynamic FPCA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implementation of dynamic functional principle component analysis (FDPCA),
simulation of functional AR and functional MA processes and frequency domain tools for funcional data.
The package is a wrapper for functionality of the multivariate package <span class="pkg">freqdom</span>
for applying frequency domain on objects from <span class="pkg">fda</span>.
Compared to <span class="pkg">freqdom</span> some new visualization methods are added â€“
adequate only if data has functional structure.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">fda.ts</span> package allows you to analyse functional time series objects
in both time and frequency domain. The main feature is dynamic functional principal component analysis.
This method allows to transform a stationary functional time series into a vector process with
mutually uncorrelated component processes.
</p>
<p>There are two key differnces between classical PCA and dynamic PCA:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Component processes returned by the dynamic procedure are mutually uncorrelated,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The mapping maximizes the long run variance of compoments, which, in case of stationary functional time series, means
that the process reconstructed from and <code class="reqn">d &gt; 0</code> first dynamic principal components
better approximates the original functional time series process than the first <code class="reqn">d</code> classic principal components.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For functional data one can conveniently visualize properties of the
filters, covariances or the spectral density operator.
</p>
<p>For details we refer to the literature below and to help pages of functions <code>fts.dpca</code>
for estimating the components, <code>fts.dpca.scores</code> for estimating scores and
<code>fts.dpca.KLexpansion</code> for retrieving the signal from components.
</p>
<p>The package <span class="pkg">fda.ts</span> require the package <span class="pkg">freqdom</span> provides the analogue multivariate toolset.
