<h2>Caniapiscau River Daily Flows</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set includes the mean daily streamflow for the Caniapiscau
River. The file has been read from the original .csv format using  
<code>read.flows</code>. The Caniapiscau River is located in Nunavik, Quebec,
Canada, and flows northward. The headwaters (representing 45 percent of the 
total flow) were dammed to create the Caniapiscau Reservoir, which started 
filling in 1981. In 1985, the reservoir was diverted to the west into the 
La Grande hydroelectric complex.
This flow time series is used as an example of a river with a known 
change point to demonstrate the package's screening capabilities.
