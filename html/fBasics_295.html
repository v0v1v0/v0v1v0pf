<h2>Upper and lower triangular matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extracs the upper or lower triangular part from a matrix.    
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">triang(x)
Triang(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>a numeric matrix.
</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>triang</code> and <code>Triang</code> transform a square matrix to a lower
or upper triangular form. The functions just replace the remaining
values with zeroes and work with non-square matrices, as well.
</p>
<p>A triangular matrix is either an upper triangular matrix or lower
triangular matrix. For the first case all matrix elements
<code>a[i,j]</code> of matrix <code>A</code> are zero for <code>i&gt;j</code>, whereas in
the second case we have just the opposite situation. A lower
triangular matrix is sometimes also called left triangular.
</p>
<p>In fact, triangular matrices are so useful that much of computational
linear algebra begins with factoring or decomposing a general matrix
or matrices into triangular form. Some matrix factorization methods
are the Cholesky factorization and the LU-factorization. Even
including the factorization step, enough later operations are
typically avoided to yield an overall time savings.
</p>
<p>Triangular matrices have the following properties: the inverse of a
triangular matrix is a triangular matrix, the product of two
triangular matrices is a triangular matrix, the determinant of a
triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal elements, the
eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are the diagonal elements.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a matrix of the same dimensions as <code>x</code> with the elements above or
below the main diagonal set to zeroes
