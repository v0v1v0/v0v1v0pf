<h2>Modified COMPAS dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>compas</code> is a landmark dataset to study algorithmic (un)fairness. This data was used to
predict recidivism (whether a criminal will reoffend or not) in the USA. The tool was meant to overcome
human biases and offer an algorithmic, fair solution to predict recidivism in a diverse population.
However, the algorithm ended up propagating existing social biases and thus, offered an unfair algorithmic
solution to the problem. In this dataset, a model to predict recidivism has already been fit and predicted
probabilities and predicted status (yes/no) for recidivism have been concatenated to the original data.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 6172 rows and 9 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Two_yr_Recidivism</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor, yes/no for recidivism or no recidivism. This is the outcome or target in this dataset</p>
</dd>
<dt>Number_of_Priors</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, number of priors, normalized to mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1</p>
</dd>
<dt>Age_Above_FourtyFive</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor, yes/no for age above 45 years or not</p>
</dd>
<dt>Age_Below_TwentyFive</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor, yes/no for age below 25 years or not</p>
</dd>
<dt>Female</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor, female/male for gender</p>
</dd>
<dt>Misdemeanor</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor, yes/no for having recorded misdemeanor(s) or not</p>
</dd>
<dt>ethnicity</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor, Caucasian, African American, Asian, Hispanic, Native American or Other</p>
</dd>
<dt>probability</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, predicted probabilities for recidivism, ranges from 0 to 1</p>
</dd>
<dt>predicted</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, predicted values for recidivism, 0/1 for no/yes</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/compass">https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/compass</a> and has undergone modifications (e.g. ethnicity was originally encoded using one-hot encoding, number or priors have been normalized, variables have been renamed, prediction model was fit and predicted probabilities and predicted status were concatenated to the original dataset).
