<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data were collected by Stewart Fischer and David Tippetts, statistics
students at the Queensland University of Technology in a subject taught by
Dr. Margaret Mackisack. Here is their description of the data and its
collection:
</p>
<p>The experiment decided upon was to see if by using two different designs of
paper aeroplane, how far the plane would travel. In considering this, the
question arose, whether different types of paper and different angles of
release would have any effect on the distance travelled. Knowing that paper
aeroplanes are greatly influenced by wind, we had to find a way to eliminate
this factor. We decided to perform the experiment in a hallway of the
University, where the effects of wind can be controlled to some extent by
closing doors.
</p>
<p>In order to make the experimental units as homogeneous as possible we
allocated one person to a task, so person 1 folded and threw all planes,
person 2 calculated the random order assignment, measured all the distances,
checked that the angles of flight were right, and checked that the plane
release was the same each time.
</p>
<p>The factors that we considered each had two levels as follows:
</p>
<p>Paper: A4 size, 80g and 50g
</p>
<p>Design: High Performance Dual Glider, and Incredibly Simple Glider (patterns
attached to original report)
</p>
<p>Angle of release: Horizontal, or 45 degrees upward.
</p>
<p>The random order assignment was calculated using the random number function
of a calculator. Each combination of factors was assigned a number from one
to eight, the random numbers were generated and accordingly the order of the
experiment was found.
