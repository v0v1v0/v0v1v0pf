<h2>Sonoluminescence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>sono</code> data frame has 16 rows and 8 columns.  Sonoluminescence is
the process of turning sound energy into light.  An experiment was conducted
to study factors affecting this process.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns: </p>

<dl>
<dt>Intensity</dt>
<dd>
<p> Sonoluminescent light intensity </p>
</dd>
<dt>Molarity</dt>
<dd>
<p> Amount of Solute. The coding is "low" for 0.10 mol
and "high" for 0.33 mol. </p>
</dd> <dt>Solute</dt>
<dd>
<p> Solute type. The coding is
"low" for sugar and "high" for glycerol. </p>
</dd> <dt>pH</dt>
<dd>
<p> The coding is
"low" for 3 and "high" for 11. </p>
</dd> <dt>Gas</dt>
<dd>
<p> Gas type in water. The
coding is "low" for helium and "high" for air. </p>
</dd> <dt>Water</dt>
<dd>
<p> Water
depth. The coding is "low" for half and "high" for full. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Horn</dt>
<dd>
<p> Horn depth. The coding is "low" for 5 mm and "high" for
10 mm. </p>
</dd> <dt>Flask</dt>
<dd>
<p> Flask clamping. The coding is "low" for
unclamped and "high" for clamped. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
