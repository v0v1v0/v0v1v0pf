<h2>Seasonal subseries plots</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A seasonal subseries plot facets the time series by each season in the
seasonal period. These facets form smaller time series plots consisting of
data only from that season. If you had several years of monthly data, the
resulting plot would show a separate time series plot for each month. The
first subseries plot would consist of only data from January. This case is
given as an example below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gg_subseries(data, y = NULL, period = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A tidy time series object (tsibble)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable to plot (a bare expression). If NULL, it will
automatically selected from the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>period</code></td>
<td>
<p>The seasonal period to display. If NULL (default),
the largest frequency in the data is used. If numeric, it represents
the frequency times the interval between observations. If a string
(e.g., "1y" for 1 year, "3m" for 3 months, "1d" for 1 day,
"1h" for 1 hour, "1min" for 1 minute, "1s" for 1 second),
it's converted to a Period class object from the lubridate package.
Note that the data must have at least one observation per seasonal period,
and the period cannot be smaller than the observation interval.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The horizontal lines are used to represent the mean of each facet, allowing
easy identification of seasonal differences between seasons. This plot is
particularly useful in identifying changes in the seasonal pattern over time.
</p>
<p>similar to a seasonal plot (<code>gg_season()</code>), and
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ggplot object showing a seasonal subseries plot of a time series.
