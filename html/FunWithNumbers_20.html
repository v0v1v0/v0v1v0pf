<h2>
Generate a sequence 'invented' by Jan Ritsema Van Eck
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates an interesting (to the author, at least) sequence listed as number A181391 in the <a href="https://oeis.org/">https://oeis.org/</a>. See Details for a full description. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">vaneck(howlong = 100, ve = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>howlong</code></td>
<td>

<p>How many terms to generate.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ve</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional argument. Enter a previously generated ("VanEck") sequence here as a numeric vector, or a single integer to use as an initiator.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>reserved for possible future use. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The rule here is that you start with 0, and whenever you get to a number you have not seen before, the following term is a 0. But if the number k has appeared previously in the sequence, then you count the number of terms since the last appearance of k, and that number is the following term. In more detail:
</p>
<p>Term 1: The first term is 0 by definition.
Term 2: Since we havent seen 0 before, the second term is 0.
Term 3: Since we have seen a 0 before, one step back, the third term is 1
Term 4: Since we havent seen a 1 before, the fourth term is 0
Term 5: Since we have seen a 0 before, two steps back, the fifth term is 2.
And so on.
As of this release of this R-package, how fast max(sequence) grows, and  whether every number eventually appears,  are open questions. The latest investigations and theorems related to this sequence can be found at <a href="https://oeis.org/A181391/">https://oeis.org/A181391/</a>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ve</code></td>
<td>

<p>The vector (ve for "VanEck") of the sequence values calculated
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>uniqs</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector of the unique values in <code>ve</code>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
