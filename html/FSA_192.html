<h2>Ages and lengths for a hypothetical sample from Westerheim and Ricker (1979).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Ages and lengths for a hypothetical sample in Westerheim and Ricker (1979).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 2369 observations on the following 3 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unique fish identifiers</p>
</dd>
<dt>len</dt>
<dd>
<p>Length of an individual fish</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>Age of an individual fish</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Age-length data in 5-cm increments taken exactly from Table 2A of the source which was a sample from a hypothetical population in which year-class strength varied in the ratio 2:1 and the rate of increase in length decreased with age. Actual lengths in each 5-cm interval were simulated with a uniform distribution. The aged fish in this file were randomly selected and an assessed age was assigned according to the information in Table 2A.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">str(WR79)
head(WR79)

## Extract the aged sample
WR79.aged &lt;- subset(WR79,!is.na(age))
str(WR79.aged)

## Extract the length sample
WR79.length &lt;- subset(WR79,is.na(age))
str(WR79.length)
