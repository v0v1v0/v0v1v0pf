<h2>Age (subsample) and length (all fish) of Snapper from two survey locations.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A large sample (not random or proportional) of Snapper (<em>Pagrus auratus</em>) were aged from otoliths, with the remainder of the fish just measured for length. Note that age-20 is actually age 19+.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 18421 observations on the following 3 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>len</dt>
<dd>
<p>Measured lengths (cm)</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ages assigned from examination of otoliths</p>
</dd>
<dt>survey</dt>
<dd>
<p>Survey location (<code>KAH8810</code> or <code>KAH0012</code>)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Topic(s)</h3>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The unaged fish were simulated from Table 5 assuming that the total number of fish was large enough that at least one fish was observed in each cell where a  proportion was listed.
