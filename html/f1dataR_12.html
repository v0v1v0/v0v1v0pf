<h2>Driver &amp; Team Look-ups</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions provide the ability to look-up drivers or teams (and match the two) for given
races or seasons.
</p>
<p><code>get_driver_abbreviation()</code> looks up the driver abbreviation (typically 3 letters) as used in the provided season.
</p>
<p><code>get_team_name()</code> looks up the officially recorded team name based on fuzzy matching to the supplied string. This is
fairly inconsistent, for example, "Haas" is recorded as "Haas F1 Team", but not all sponsor names are recorded nor are
all names indicating 'F1 Team' â€“  "RB" is recorded as "RB" and not "Visa Cash App RB F1 Team". If <code>short = TRUE</code> then
a short form for the team is provided ("Haas" instead of "Haas F1 Team").
</p>
<p><code>get_driver_name()</code> looks up a driver's full name based on fuzzy matching to the supplied string. The driver has to
have participated in the session (season, round, session) for this to match properly. For full-time drivers this is
easy, but for rookies who do test FP1 this is a more important note.
</p>
<p><code>get_drivers_by_team()</code> looks up a team's drivers for the provided race session (season, round, session). If looking
for practice rookies, they typically participate in <code>session = FP1</code>.
</p>
<p><code>get_team_by_driver()</code> looks up the team for the specified driver (at the specified race event).
</p>
<p><code>get_session_drivers_and_teams()</code> returns a data frame of all drivers and their team for a provided session.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_driver_abbreviation(
  driver_name,
  season = get_current_season(),
  round = 1,
  session = "R"
)

get_driver_name(
  driver_name,
  season = get_current_season(),
  round = 1,
  session = "R"
)

get_team_name(team_name, season = get_current_season(), short = FALSE)

get_drivers_by_team(
  team_name,
  season = get_current_season(),
  round = 1,
  session = "R"
)

get_team_by_driver(
  driver_name,
  season = get_current_season(),
  round = 1,
  short = FALSE
)

get_session_drivers_and_teams(season, round, session = "R")
</code></pre>
