<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A sagittal slice from the fMRI time series for subject 0051479. The scan was
obtained at the California Institute of Technology. The scan has
been pre-processed with slice time correction, rigid body realignment
estimation, spatial normalization to MNI space, and linear detrending.
Subject 0051479 was a typically-developing 20-year-old female. The scan has
few visible artifacts. A mask was applied to vectorize the spatial
dimensions.
