<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To include multiple independent variables, you need to use the stepwise functions.
There are 5 stepwise functions: <code>sw</code>, <code>sw0</code>, <code>csw</code>, <code>csw0</code> and <code>mvsw</code>. Let's explain that.
</p>
<p>Assume you have the following formula: <code>fml = y ~ x1 + sw(x2, x3)</code>. The stepwise
function <code>sw</code> will estimate the following two models: <code>y ~ x1 + x2</code> and <code>y ~ x1 + x3</code>.
That is, each element in <code>sw()</code> is sequentially, and separately, added to the formula.
Would have you used <code>sw0</code> in lieu of <code>sw</code>, then the model <code>y ~ x1</code> would also have
been estimated. The <code>0</code> in the name implies that the model without any stepwise
element will also be estimated.
</p>
<p>Finally, the prefix <code>c</code> means cumulative: each stepwise element is added to the next.
That is, <code>fml = y ~ x1 + csw(x2, x3)</code> would lead to the following models <code>y ~ x1 + x2</code>
and <code>y ~ x1 + x2 + x3</code>. The <code>0</code> has the same meaning and would also lead to the model
without the stepwise elements to be estimated: in other words,
<code>fml = y ~ x1 + csw0(x2, x3)</code> leads to the following three models: <code>y ~ x1</code>,
<code>y ~ x1 + x2</code> and <code>y ~ x1 + x2 + x3</code>.
</p>
<p>The last stepwise function, <code>mvsw</code>, refers to 'multiverse' stepwise. It will estimate
as many models as there are unique combinations of stepwise variables. For example
<code>fml = y ~ x1 + mvsw(x2, x3)</code> will estimate <code>y ~ x1</code>, <code>y ~ x1 + x2</code>, <code>y ~ x1 + x3</code>,
<code>y ~ x1 + x2 + x3</code>. Beware that the number of estimations grows pretty fast (<code>2^n</code>,
with <code>n</code> the number of stewise variables)!

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
base = setNames(iris, c("y", "x1", "x2", "x3", "species"))

# Regular stepwise
feols(y ~ sw(x1, x2, x3), base)

# Cumulative stepwise
feols(y ~ csw(x1, x2, x3), base)

# Using the 0
feols(y ~ x1 + x2 + sw0(x3), base)

# Multiverse stepwise
feols(y ~ x1 + mvsw(x2, x3), base)
