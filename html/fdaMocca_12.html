<h2>Varved sediment data from lake Kassjön</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Annually varved lake sediment data from the lake Kassjön in Northern Sweden. The Kassjön data are used to illustrate the ideas of the model-based functional clustering with covariates. The varved sediment of lake Kassjön covers approximately 6400 years and is believed to be historical records of weather and climate.  The varves (years) are clustered into similar groups based on their seasonal patterns (functional data) and additional covariates, all potentially carrying information on past climate/weather. 
</p>
<p>The Kassjön data has been analyzed in several papers. In Petterson et al. (2010, 1999, 1993) the sediment data was captured with image analysis and after preprocessing, the data was recorded as gray scale values with yearly deliminators, thus giving 6388 years (-4386 – 1901), or varves with 4–36 gray scale values per year. In Arnqvist et al. (2016) the shape/form of the
yearly grey scale observations was modeled as curve functions and analyzed in a non-parametric functional data analysis approach. In Abramowicz et al. (2016) a Bagging Voronoi K-Medoid Alignment (BVKMA) method was proposed to group the varves into different "climates". The suggested procedure simultaneously clusters and aligns spatially dependent curves and is a nonparametric statistical method that does not
rely on distributional or dependency structure assumptions.

<h3>Format</h3>

 <p><code>varve</code> data is a list containing six objects named as <code>x</code>, <code>time</code>, <code>timeindex</code>, <code>curve</code>, <code>grid</code>, <code>covariates</code>. See <code>mocca</code> for explanation of these objects. 
</p>
<p><code>varve_full</code> has <code class="reqn">N=6326</code> observed subjects (years/varve), where for each varve we observed one function (seasonal pattern) and four covariates. <code>varve</code> is simply a reduced data set with only <code class="reqn">N=1493</code> subjects.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The varve patterns have the following origin. During
spring, in connection to snow melt and spring runoff, minerogenic material is
transported from the catchment area into the lake through four small streams, which
gives rise to a bright colored layer, giving high gray-scale values (Petterson et al., 2010). During summer, autochthonous organic matter, sinks to the bottom and creates a darker layer (lower gray-scale values). During the winter, when the lake is
ice-covered, fine organic material is deposited, resulting in a thin blackish winter layer
(lowest gray-scale values). There is substantial within- and between year
variation, reflecting the balance between minerogenic and organic material. The
properties of each varve reflect, to a large extent, weather conditions and internal
biological processes in the lake the year that the varve was deposited. The minerogenic
input reflects the intensity of the spring run-off, which is dependent on the amount of
snow accumulated during the winter, and hence the variability in past winter climate.
</p>
<p>The data consists of <code class="reqn">N = 6326</code> (subjects) years and the <code class="reqn">n_i</code> observations per year
ranges from 4 to 37. A few years were missing, see Arnqvist et al. (2016) for details. For
each year <code class="reqn">i</code> we observe the centered seasonal pattern in terms of grey scale values (<code class="reqn">y_i</code>)'s
at <code class="reqn">n_i</code> time points (pixels). We also register (the four covariates) the mean grey scale
within each year, the varve width <code class="reqn">n_i</code> and the minerogenic accumulation rate (<code class="reqn">mg/cm^2</code>)
corresponding to the total amount of minerogenic material per <code class="reqn">cm^2</code> in the varve (year) <code class="reqn">i</code>,
see Petterson et al. (2010) for details. In order to make the seasonal patterns comparable
we first put them on the same time scale <code class="reqn">[0,1]</code>, such that pixel position <code class="reqn">j</code> at year <code class="reqn">i</code>
corresponds to position <code class="reqn">\tilde{t}_{ij} = (j-1)/(n_i-1),~ j = 1, ..., n _i, ~i = 1, ..., N.</code> To make
the patterns more comparable (with respect to climate) they were further aligned by
landmark registration, synchronizing the first spring peaks, that are directly related to
the spring flood that occurs approximately the same time each year.
</p>
<p>As in previous analysis (Arnqvist et al., 2016) the first peak of each year is aligned
towards a common spring peak with an affine warping, that is, if we denote the common
spring peak as <code class="reqn">M_L</code> and the yearly spring peak as <code class="reqn">L_i,~ i = 1, ..., N</code> and let <code class="reqn">b = M_L/L_i</code>,
<code class="reqn">d=(1-M_L)/(1-L_i)</code> then we will have the warped time points according to <code class="reqn">w(t_{ij}) = t_{ij}b</code>
for <code class="reqn">t_{ij} &lt; L_i</code> and <code class="reqn">w(t_{ij}) = 1 + d(t_{ij}-1)</code> for <code class="reqn">t_{ij}\geq L_i</code>. The common spring peak and the
yearly spring peaks are given in Arnqvist et al. (2016).
</p>
<p>Focusing on the functional forms of the seasonal patterns we finally centered them
within years and worked with (the centered values) <code class="reqn">y_i(t_{ij}) -\bar{y}_i,~ j = 1, ..., n_i,~ i = 1,...,N</code>
where <code class="reqn">\bar{y}_i=\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}y_i(t_{ij})/n_i</code> is the mean grey scale value of varve (year) <code class="reqn">i</code>. In addition
to the seasonal patterns we also include four covariates: i) <code class="reqn">x_{1i}=\bar{y}_i</code>, the mean grey scale; ii) <code class="reqn">x_{2i} = n_i</code>, the varve width (proportional to <code class="reqn">n_i</code>); iii) <code class="reqn">x_{3i}</code>, the minerogenic accumulation rate
corresponding to the accumulated amount of minerogenic material per <code class="reqn">cm^2</code> in varve <code class="reqn">i</code>; and iv) <code class="reqn">x_{4i}</code>, the landmark which is the distance from the start of the year to the first peak, interpreted as the start of the spring, for details see (Petterson et al., 2010, and and Arnqvist et al. 2016).
