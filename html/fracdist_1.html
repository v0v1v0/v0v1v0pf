<h2>Numerical CDFs for
Fractional Unit Root and Cointegration Tests</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A package for calculating numerical distribution functions of fractional
unit root and cointegration test statistics. The included functions calculate
critical values and P-values used in unit root tests, cointegration tests,
and rank tests in the Fractionally Cointegrated Vector
Autoregression (FCVAR) model (see Johansen and Nielsen, 2012).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Simple tabulation is not a feasible approach for obtaining
critical values and P-values because these distributions depend
on a real-valued parameter <code>b</code> that must be estimated.
Instead, response surface regressions are used to obtain the numerical
distribution functions and combined by model averaging
across values taken from a series of tables.
As a function of the dimension of the problem, <code>q</code>,
and a value of the fractional integration order <code>b</code>,
this approach provides either a set of critical values or the asymptotic P-value
for any value of the likelihood ratio statistic.
The P-values and critical values are calculated by interpolating from the
quantiles on a grid of probabilities and values of the fractional integration order,
with separate tables for a range of values of cointegrating rank.
</p>
<p>The functions in this package are based on the functions and subroutines in the
Fortran program <code>fracdist.f</code> to accompany an article by MacKinnon and Nielsen (2014).
This program is available from the archive of the <em>Journal of Applied Econometrics</em>
at <a href="http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/datasets/mackinnon004/">http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/datasets/mackinnon004/</a>.
Alternatively, a C++ implementation of this program is also available; see
