<h2>Unconditional and conditional simulation of a spatial process</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates exact (or approximate) random draws from the unconditional or
conditional 
distribution of a spatial process given specific observations. 
Draws from the conditional distribution, known as conditional simulation in geostatistics,  is a 
useful way to characterize the uncertainty in the predicted process from 
data.  Note that exact simulation is limted by the number of locations but there are approximate strategies to handle simulation for large grids of locations.  
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These functions generate samples from an unconditional or conditional multivariate (spatial) 
distribution, or an approximate one. The <strong>unconditional</strong> simulation function,
<code>simSpatialData</code>,
is a handy way to generate synthetic observations from a fitted model.
Typically one would use these for a parametric bootstrap.
The functions that simulate <strong>conditional</strong> distributions are much
more involved
in their coding. They are useful
for describing the uncertainty in predictions using the estimated spatial 
process under Gaussian assumptions. An important assumption throughout 
these functions is that all covariance parameters are fixed at their 
estimated or prescribed values from the passed object. Although these functions might
be coded up easily by the users these
versions have the advantage that they take the <code>mKrig</code>, <code>spatialProcess</code> or
<code>Krig</code> objects as a way to specify the
model in an unambiguous way. 
</p>
<p>Given a spatial process  h(x)= P(x) + g(x) observed at 
</p>
<p>Y.k =  Z(x.k)d + P(x.k) + g(x.k) + e.k
</p>
<p>where P(x) is a low order, fixed polynomial and g(x) a Gaussian spatial 
process and Z(x.k) is a vector of covariates that are also indexed by space (such as elevation).
Z(x.k)d is a linear combination of the covariates with the parameter vector d being a
component of the fixed part of the 
model and estimated in the usual way by generalized least squares.
</p>
<p>With Y= Y.1, ..., Y.N,
the goal is to sample the conditional distribution of the process. 
</p>
<p>[h(x) | Y ]  or the full prediction Z(x)d + h(x)
</p>
<p>For fixed a covariance this is just a multivariate normal sampling
problem.  <code>sim.spatialProcess</code> samples this conditional process at
the points <code>xp</code> and is exact for fixed covariance parameters.
</p>
<p>The outline of the conditional simulation algorithm is given below and has the
advantage that is only depends on the unconditional simulation
of the spatial process and being able to make a spatial prediction - the
conditional mean of the process given the observations and covariance function.
</p>
<p><strong> Conditional Simulation Algorithm: </strong>
</p>
<p>0) Find the spatial prediction at the unobserved locations based on
the actual data. Call this h.hat(x) and this is also  the conditional mean. 
</p>
<p>1) Generate a realization that includes both prediction and observation locations from the unconditional spatial process and from this process
simluate synthetic observations. 
</p>
<p>2) Use the spatial prediction model ( using the true covariance) to
estimate the spatial process at unobserved locations.
</p>
<p>3) Find the difference between the simulated process and its
prediction based on synthetic observations. Call this e(x).
</p>
<p>4) h.hat(x) + e(x) is a draw from [h(x) | Y ].
</p>
<p>The approximations for this simulation come in at step 1).
Here the field at the observation locations is
approximated using a local conditional simulation from
the nearest grid points. 
</p>
<p>NOTE: A fixed part in the model is handled easily by
simply
making the prediction from the synthetic observations
that have mean zero but include estimation of the
fixed part as part of the prediction. 
Because the
regression estimates are unbaised, this gives a
valid draw from the correct mulitvariate distribution
even though the synthetic observations do not include
a fixed part. 
</p>
<p><code>sim.spatialProcess</code> Follows this algorithm exactly. For the case of an
addtional covariate  this of course needs to be included. For a model
with covariates use <code>drop.Z=TRUE</code> for the function to ignore prediction
using the covariate and generate conditional samples for just the spatial
process and any low order polynomial. Finally, it should be noted that this
function will also work with an <code>mKrig</code> object because the essential
prediction information in the mKrig and spatialProcess objects are the same.
The naming is through convenience. 
</p>
<p><code>sim.Krig</code>  Also follows this algorithm exactly but for the older <code>Krig</code> object.  Note that  the inclusion of
drop.Z=TRUE or FALSE will determine whether the conditional simulation 
includes the covariates Z or not. (See example below.) 
</p>
<p><code>simLocal.spatialProcess</code> This function is
designed for conditional simulation for a large
prediction grid and for a large number of observation
s. The approximation will be accurate for fine grids
that separate clusters of observation locations. E.g.
multiple observations in a single gridbox are treated
exactly. If observation location are separated by a
grid box then due to the screening effect the
approximation error will be negliable, especially if a
nugget component  (tau ) is present. 
</p>
<p>The 1D version of this function will not be much more
efficient than an exact computation. However, it is
included as easy to read source code and for checking
(see examples.)
</p>
<p>See the utility function <code>offGridWeights</code> for the function that creates weights used to generate the (approximate) conditional sample.  The functions 
<code>checkPredictGrid</code>, 
<code>makePredictionGridList</code> and 
<code>makeSimulationGrid</code> are utilities to setup the grids when not 
specified. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>sim.Krig and sim.spatialProcess</code>
a matrix with rows indexed by the locations in <code>xp</code> and columns being the 
<code>M</code> independent draws.
</p>
<p><code>simLocal.spatialProcess</code> a list with components <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>
and <code>z</code> being the simulations at the prediction grid.
The x and y are the typical image format specifying a regular grid.  If
<code>nx</code> and <code>ny</code> are the lengths of the grid values in X and Y then  <code>z</code>
is a array with dimension  <code> c(nx, ny, M)</code>. For the 1D case ny is set to 1.
The component <code>hHat</code> is the conditional mean ( as an 
<code>nx</code> X <code>ny</code> matrix)  and the remaining arguments
are various timing results for parts of the computation.
