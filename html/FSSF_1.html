<h2>Large-Scale Fully-Sequential Space-filling Algorithms for Computer Experiments</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides large-scale computer experimental design tools to generate fully-sequential (a nested sequence of designs with points added one at a time) space-filling designs inside a unit hypercube (Shang and Apley, 2019).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Fully-sequential (i.e., with design points added one at a time) space-filling designs are useful for global surrogate modeling of expensive computer experiments when the number of design points required to achieve a suitable accuracy is unknown in advance. We provide three fully-sequential space-filling (FSSF) design algorithms that are conceptually simple and computationally efficient and that achieve much better space-filling properties than alternative methods such as Sobol sequences and more complex batch-sequential methods based on sliced or nested optimal Latin hypercube designs (LHDs). 
</p>
<p>Brief descriptions of the main functions are provided below:
</p>
<p><code>fssf_f()</code> generates maximin designs using a similar idea with Kennard and Stone (1969). The "f" stands for "forward", since the algorithm begins with the smallest design and adds points one at a time.
</p>
<p><code>fssf-b()</code> generates large-size maximin designs efficiently. The "b" stands for "backward", since the algorithm begins with the largest design and removes points one at a time.
</p>
<p><code>fssf-fr()</code> uses a heuristic to generate what is closer to a minimax design. The "fr" stands for "forward reflected", since the algorithm uses a modification of the criterion used in the fssf-f algorithm.
