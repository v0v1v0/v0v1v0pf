<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>bdII</code>, <code>bdII_fit</code> and <code>bdII_nll</code> were deprecated and removed from FRAIR in version 0.5. Although internally consistent, this code did not actually model the Beddington-DeAngelis type-II curve, as advertised. This code used in these functions was renamed emdII. A correct implementation of the Beddington-DeAngelis type-II curve (assuming replacement) will be added at some point in the future.  
</p>
<p>The <code>real77*</code> family were deprecated and removed from FRAIR in version 0.5. These functions were poorly specified, with unhelpful (that is to say: incorrect) definitions of the exponent term (<code>q</code>). More sensible flexible exponent model specifications (<code>flexp</code> and <code>flexpnr</code>) have been added as a replacement.  
</p>
<p>The <code>hassIIIr</code> model was renamed to <code>hassIIInr</code> in version 0.5. The previous name was confusing. The new name better reflects that it is a '<strong>n</strong>on-<strong>r</strong>eplacement' model.
