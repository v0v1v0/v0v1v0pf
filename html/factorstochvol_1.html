<h2>Bayesian Estimation of (Sparse) Latent Factor Stochastic
Volatility Models through MCMC</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This packages provides a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler
for fully Bayesian estimation of latent factor stochastic volatility
models. Sparsity can be achieved through the usage of Normal-Gamma
priors on the factor loadings matrix.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In recent years, multivariate factor stochastic volatility (SV)
models have been increasingly used to analyze financial and economic
time series because they can capture joint (co-)volatility dynamics
by a small number of latent time-varying factors. The main advantage
of such a model is its parsimony, as all variances and covariances
of a time series vector are governed by a low-dimensional common factor
with the components following independent SV models. For problems of
this kind, MCMC is a very efficient estimation method, it is however
associated with a considerable computational burden when the number
of assets is moderate to large. To overcome this, the latent volatility
states are drawn "all without a loop" (AWOL), ancillarity-sufficiency
interweaving strategies (ASIS) are applied to sample the univariate
components as well as the factor loadings. Thus, this package can
be applied directly estimate time-varying covariance and correlation
matrices for medium-and high-dimensional time series. To guarantee
sparsity, a hierarchical Normal-Gamma prior can be used for the
factor loadings matrix which shrinks the unnecessary factor loadings
towards zero.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This package is currently in active development; the interface
of some of the functions might change.
Moreover, even though I tried to carefully check everything,
factorstochvol may still contain
typos, inconsistencies, or even bugs. Your comments and suggestions
are warmly welcome!
