<h2>
Plot an overview of all penalties taken by or against a men's Bundesliga player.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Search for a player – either exact match or using fixed regular expressions – and
create a plot of all penalties taken by or against this player as table with the date
on the x-axis and the result on the y-axis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">penaltyPlot(player, goalkeeper = TRUE, exact = TRUE, pendat, includeMisses = TRUE,
  quarterlyAxis = TRUE, colours = NULL, main = NULL, sub = NULL, jitter = TRUE,
  yvalconst = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>player</code></td>
<td>

<p>Character vector of length 1 which contains the full name of a player in <code>pendat</code>
or a part thereof.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>goalkeeper</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, specifies whether <code>player</code> is searched for among goalkeepers (TRUE)
or penalty takers (FALSE).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exact</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, specifies whether to look for an exact match. If set to FALSE,
<code>grep(player, fixed = TRUE)</code> is used to search for the player.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pendat</code></td>
<td>

<p>Name of a data set containing the penalties. The data set needs to follow the
format of <code>penalties</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>includeMisses</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, indicates whether to include penalties that missed the goal without the
goalkeeper actively saving the ball.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quarterlyAxis</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, to customise the x-axis. If TRUE, the beginning of every quarter of each year
will be included on the axis, if FALSE, only the beginning of each year will be marked.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>colours</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of length 3 that indicate the colours for saves, misses, and goals. The default
value tries to reflect the relative success of each outcome for goalkeepers and penalty takers.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>main</code></td>
<td>

<p>Main title of the plot. The default indicates who the penalties were taken by or against.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sub</code></td>
<td>

<p>Subtitle of the plot. The defaults indicates whether missed shots were included or not.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>jitter</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, should observations be jittered along the y-axis to avoid overlap?
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>yvalconst</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, if TRUE, all penalties are plotted with a constant y-value (jitter may be added
afterwards if <code>jitter = TRUE</code>). If FALSE, saves, misses, and goals are plotted with
three different y-values (plus possible jitter). A legend is added to the top of the plot
in that case.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(penalties)
# Basic goalkeeper plot with quarterly and yearly marks. Depending on the duration of the career,
# quarterly marks may be too cluttered.
penaltyPlot('Illgner', pendat = penalties, exact = FALSE)
penaltyPlot('Illgner', pendat = penalties, exact = FALSE, quarterly = FALSE)

# similar plot for a penalty taker
penaltyPlot('Polster', pendat = penalties, exact = FALSE, quarterly = FALSE, goalkeeper = FALSE)

# demonstrate the effect of keeping the value on the y-axis constant as well as of excluding misses
penaltyPlot('Neuer', pendat = penalties, exact = FALSE, quarterly = FALSE)
penaltyPlot('Neuer', pendat = penalties, exact = FALSE, quarterly = FALSE, yvalconst = TRUE)
penaltyPlot('Neuer', pendat = penalties, exact = FALSE, quarterly = FALSE, includeMisses = FALSE)
