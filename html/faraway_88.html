<h3>Details</h3>

<p>On the 8th January 2008, primaries to select US presidential candidates were
held in New Hampshire. In the Democratic party primary, Hillary Clinton
defeated Barack Obama contrary to the expectations pre-election opinion
polls. Essentially two different voting technologies were used in New
Hampshire. Some wards used paper ballots, counted by hand while others used
optically scanned ballots, counted by machine. Among the paper ballots,
Obama had more votes than Clinton while Clinton defeated Obama on just the
machine counted ballots. Since the method of voting should make no causal
difference to the outcome, suspicions have been raised regarding the
integrity of the election.
