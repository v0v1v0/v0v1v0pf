<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of criminal offenders screened in Florida (US) during 2013-14.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(compas)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data contains 5855 observations and the following variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>age</code>, a continuous variable containing the age (in years) of the
person;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>juv_fel_count</code>, a continuous variable containing the number of
juvenile felonies;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>decile_score</code>, a continuous variable, the decile of the COMPAS
score;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>juv_misd_count</code>, a continuous variable containing the number of
juvenile misdemeanors;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>juv_other_count</code>, a continuous variable containing the number
of prior juvenile convictions that are not considered either felonies or
misdemeanors;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>v_decile_score</code>, a continuous variable containing the predicted
decile of the COMPAS score;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>priors_count</code>, a continuous variable containing the number of
prior crimes committed;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sex</code>, a factor with levels <code>"Female"</code> and <code>"Male"</code>;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>two_year_recid</code>, a factor with two levels <code>"Yes"</code> and
<code>"No"</code> (if the person has recidivated within two years);
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>race</code>, a factor encoding the race of the person;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>c_jail_in</code>, a numeric variable containing the date in which the
person entered jail (normalized between 0 and 1);
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>c_jail_out</code>, a numeric variable containing the date in which the
person was released from jail (normalized between 0 and 1);
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>c_offense_date</code>, a numeric variable containing the date the
offense was committed;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>screening_date</code>, a numeric variable containing the date in which
the person was screened (normalized between 0 and 1);
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>in_custody</code>, a numeric variable containing the date in which the
person was placed in custody (normalized between 0 and 1);
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>out_custody</code>, a numeric variable containing the date in which
the person was released from custody (normalized between 0 and 1);
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The data set has been pre-processed as in Komiyama et al. (2018), with the
following exceptions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> the <code>race</code> variable has not been reduced to a binary factor with
levels <code>"African-American"</code> and <code>"not African-American"</code>;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the variables <code>type_of_assessment</code>, <code>v_type_of_assessment</code>
have been dropped from the analysis because they take the same value for
all observations;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> variables like <code>c_jail_in</code> and <code>c_jail_out</code> that encode
dates have been jointly rescaled to preserve the temporal ordering of
events.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In that paper, <code>two_year_recid</code> is the response variable, <code>sex</code> and
<code>race</code> are the sensitive attributes and the remaining variables are
used as predictors.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(compas)

# convert the response back to a numeric variable.
compas$two_year_recid = as.numeric(compas$two_year_recid) - 1

# short-hand variable names.
r = compas[, "two_year_recid"]
s = compas[, c("sex", "race")]
p = compas[, setdiff(names(compas), c("two_year_recid", "sex", "race"))]

m = nclm(response = r, sensitive = s, predictors = p, unfairness = 0.05)
summary(m)

m = frrm(response = r, sensitive = s, predictors = p, unfairness = 0.05)
