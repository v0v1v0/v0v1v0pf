<h2>Calculate flight emissions based on airport code pairs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function that calculates emissions per flight based on pairs of three-letter airport codes, flight classes, and emissions metrics. Emissions are returned in kilograms of the chosen metric.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">airport_footprint(
  departure,
  arrival,
  flightClass = "Unknown",
  output = "co2e",
  year = 2019
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>departure</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector naming one or more three-letter IATA (International Air Transport Association) airport codes for outbound destination</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>arrival</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector naming one or more three-letter IATA (International Air Transport Association) airport codes for inbound destination</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flightClass</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector naming one or more flight class categories. Must be of the following "Unknown" "Economy", "Economy+", "Business" or "First". If no argument is included, "Unknown" is the default and represents the average passenger.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output</code></td>
<td>
<p>a single character argument naming the emissions metric of the output. For metrics that include radiative forcing, one of
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "co2e" (carbon dioxide equivalent with radiative forcing) - default
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "co2" (carbon dioxide with radiative forcing)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "ch4" (methane with radiative forcing)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "n2o" (nitrous oxide with radiative forcing)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Metrics without radiative forcing: "co2e_norf", "co2_norf", "ch4_norf", or "n2o_norf".
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>year</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric or string representing a year between 2019-2024, inclusive. Default is 2019.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Distances between airports are based on the Haversine great-circle distane formula, which assumes a spherical earth. They are calculated using the <code>airportr</code> package. The carbon footprint estimates are derived from the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (UK) Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors for Business Travel (air). These factors vary by year, which can be acounted for by the <code>year</code> argument.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a numeric value expressed in kilograms of chosen metric
