<h2>Aggregate Log-Likelihood Function for Federated Learning</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the sum of log-likelihoods across multiple schools in a federated learning setting. The function <code>logL_entry</code> aggregates contribution of each school's log-likelihood to the overall model. It is designed to be used within the optimization process of <code>fedirt</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">logL_entry(ps)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ps</code></td>
<td>
<p>A parameter vector consisting of item parameters; it should include both discrimination (a) and difficulty (b) parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In a federated learning context, each school computes its log-likelihood locally. The <code>logL_entry</code> function is responsible for aggregating these values. Users are expected to provide an implementation for <code>getlogL_from_index</code>, which should include network requests to retrieve log-likelihoods calculated by each school, or for simplified prototyping purposes, could directly use a <code>logL</code> function to compute likelihoods locally.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The sum of log-likelihoods as a single numeric value, representing the likelihood of the entire federated dataset under the current model's parameters.
