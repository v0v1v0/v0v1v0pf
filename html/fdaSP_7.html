<h2>Sparse Functional Data Analysis Methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides algorithms to fit linear regression models under several popular penalization techniques and functional linear regression models based on Majorizing-Minimizing (MM) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) techniques.
    See Boyd et al (2010) &lt;doi:10.1561/2200000016&gt; for complete introduction to the method.</p>
