<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">partisan_lean_state
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataset with 50 rows representing states and 3 variables
</p>

<dl>
<dt>state</dt>
<dd>
<p>the state</p>
</dd>
<dt>pvi_party</dt>
<dd>
<p>the party of the vote</p>
</dd>
<dt>pvi_amount</dt>
<dd>
<p>the Cook Partisan Voting Index of the vote</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The original dataset only has 2 columns: "state" and "pvi_538". I separated the "pvi_538" columns into two.
For example, in row 1 of the dataset, the original "pvi_538" = "R+27", and I separated it into â€œpvi_party" = "R" and "pvi_amount" = "27".

<h3>Source</h3>
