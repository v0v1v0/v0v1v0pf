<h3>1 Introduction</h3>

<p>The package <code>fMultivar</code> was written to explore and investigate
bivariate and multivariate financial return series. 
The bivariate modeling allows us the comparison of financial returns
from two investments or from one investment and its benchmark. When 
it comes to the investigation of multiple investment returns from 
funds or portfolios we are concerned with the multivariate case.
</p>
<p>In the case of bivariate distribution functions we provide functions
for the 2-dimensional Cauchy, Normal, and Student-t distributions.
A generalisation (for the density only) is made for the family of 
2-dimensional elliptical distributions. In this case we provide density
functions for the Normal, Cauchy, Student-t, Logistic, Laplace, Kotz, 
e-Power distributions.
</p>
<p>In the case of multivariate distribution functions from the skew-normal 
(SN) family and some related ones we recommend to 
use the density funtions, probability functions and random number
generators provided by Azzalini's contributed package <code>sn</code>.
The family of his SN-distributions cover the skew Cauchy, the skew
Normal, and the skew Student-t distributions. For parameter fitting
we have added three simple wrapper functions for an easy to use
approach to estimate the distributional parameters for financial
return series.
</p>
<p>In the case of multivariate distribution functions from the generalized
hyperbolic (GHYP) family and some related ones we recommend to 
use the density funtions, probability functions and random number
generators provided by David Luethi and Wolfgang Breymann's contributed 
package <code>ghyp</code>.
The family of their GHYP-distributions cover beside the General
Hyperbolic distribution (GHYP) also the special cases for the
Hyperbolic distribution (HYP), for the Normal Inverse Gaussian 
distribution (NIG), for the Variance Gamma distribution (VG), and 
for the skewed Student-t distribution (GHST).
</p>


<h3>2 Bivariate Distributions</h3>

<p>This section contains functions to model bivariate density, 
probability, quantile functions, and to generate random numbers
for three standard distributions.
</p>
<pre>
  [dpr]cauchy2d         Bivariate Cauchy Distribution
  [dpr]norm2d           Bivariate Normal Disribution
  [dpr]t2d              Bivariate Student-t Disribution
  </pre>
<p>The density function 
</p>
<pre>
  delliptical2d         Bivariate Elliptical Densities
  </pre>
<p>computes for several bivariate elliptical distributions their
densities. Included distributions are the following types:
<code>"norm"</code>, <code>"cauchy"</code>, <code>"t"</code>, <code>"logistic"</code>, 
<code>"laplace"</code>, <code>"kotz"</code>, and <code>"epower"</code>.
</p>


<h3>3 Multivariate Symmetric Distributions</h3>

<pre>
  [dpr]              Multivariate Cauchy Distribution
  [dpr]              Multivariate Normal Distribution
  [dpr]              Multivariate Student-t Distribution
  
  [dpr]              Multivariate Truncated Normal Distribution
  </pre>


<h3>3 Multivariate Skew Distributions</h3>

<p>We use the functions from the contributed package <code>"sn"</code> package 
to model multivariate density and probability functions, and to 
generate random numbers for the skew Cauchy, Normal and Student-t
distributions. Note the symmetric case is also included in these
functions. The functions are:
</p>
<pre>
  [dpr]msc              Multivariate Skew Cauchy Distribution
  [dpr]msn              Multivariate Skew Normal Distribution
  [dpr]mst              Multivariate Skew Student-t Distribution
  </pre>
<p>Note the functions are not part of the <code>fMultivar</code> package they
depend on the <code>"sn"</code> package and are loaded when <code>fMultivar</code> 
is loaded.
</p>
<p>NOTE: In the new version of the <code>fMultivar</code> package the following 
two distribution functions <code>*mvsnorm</code> (multivariate Normal 
distribution) and <code>*mvst</code> (multivariate Student-t Distribution)
will become obsolete together with the <code>mvFit</code> parameter
estimation function. The functionality is fully covered by the 
<code>"sn"</code> package. (They will be most likely deprecated in the 
future.)
</p>
<p>For parameter estimation please use the simple wrapper functions:
</p>
<pre>
  mscFit                Multivariate Skew Cauchy Fit
  msnFit                Multivariate Skew Normal Fit
  mstFit                Multivariate Skew Student-t Fit
  </pre>
<p>Thes parameter estimation functions will be in the same style
as all the other fitting functions in other Rmetrics packages.
</p>


<h3>4 Multivariate GHYP Distributions</h3>

<p>We refer to the package <code>"ghyp"</code> authored by
David Luethi and  Wolfgang Breymann,
</p>


<h3>5 Utility Functions</h3>

<p>We have also added some very useful utility functions for the
bivariate case, these include 2-D grid generation, squared and
hexagonal binned histograms, 2-D kernel density estimates, 
bivariate histogram plots:
</p>
<pre>
  grid2d                Bivariate Square Grid of Coordinates
  binning2d             Bivariate Square/Hexagonal Binning Plot
  density2d             Bivariate Kernel Density Plot
  hist2d                Bivariate Histogram Plot
  gridData              Bivariate gridded data set
  </pre>
<p>For integration we have added two quadratur routines a simple one
for the bivariate case and an adaptive one for the multivariate case:
</p>
<pre>
  integrate2d           Bivariate Integration
  adapt                 Multivariate adaptive Quadratur
  </pre>
<p>The function <code>adapt</code> is a wrapper to the function 
<code>adaptIntegrate</code> from the new contributed package
<code>cubature</code> authored by Stephan G. Johnson.
</p>
