<h2>
Matrix indices
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Matrix-level indices are calculated, including the number of connections, connection density, number of concepts, number of transmitters, number of receivers, number of no connections, number of ordinary, number of self-loops, connections per variable, complexity, and hierarchy.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">matrix.indices(matrix)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>matrix</code></td>
<td>

<p>A quantitative fuzzy cognitive matrix.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The fuzzy cognitive maps should be in the form of a quantitative adjacency matrix.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe containing the number of connections, connection density, number of concepts, number of transmitters, number of receivers, number of no connections, number of ordinary, number of self-loops, connections per variable, complexity, and hierarchy.
