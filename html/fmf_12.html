<h2>
Iris Data Set
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda &amp; Hart, for example.) 
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(iris)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 150 Instances and 4 attributes (including the class attribute, "Species")
In this package, the iris dataset has been normalized by the max-min normalization.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Fisher,R.A. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in "Contributions to Mathematical Statistics" (John Wiley, NY, 1950). 
</p>
<p>Predicted attribute: class of iris plant. 
</p>
<p>This is an exceedingly simple domain. 
</p>
<p>This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick '@' espeedaz.net ). 
The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.
