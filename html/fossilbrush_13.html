<h2>flag_ranges</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to compare stratigraphic ranges in x to a
set of reference ranges from y. A list of two elements
is returned. The first is a dataframe summarising
the overall error status, specific error counts
FAD and LAD differences, and the 95% density
distributions of the FAD and LAD errors for each
unique taxon in the column of x denoted by the first
element of xcols. If a taxon in x is not present in
y, it is assigned the status 000 and its other
entries in the returned dataframe will be NA.
The second element of the returned list is the error
code for every individual element of the column of
x denoted by the first element of xcols - this will
have the same number of rows as x. If x is a range
table rather than an occurrence dataset, then the two
list elements will have the same number of rows.
Ranges for comparison may be supplied directly in y,
or y may be another occurrence dataset, in which case
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">flag_ranges(
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  xcols = c("genus", "max_ma", "min_ma"),
  ycols = NULL,
  flag.diff = 5,
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Stratigraphic range data for taxa as a whole
or for individual fossil occurrences</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>The same as in x. This is the dataset to
which ranges will be compared</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xcols</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of length three
specifying, in the following order, the taxonomic name,
stratigraphic base (FAD) and stratigraphic top (LAD)
columns in x.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ycols</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional character vector of length
three for the same column types as in xcols, but for
dataset y. This is useful if the column names differ
between the datasets</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flag.diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of thresholds, given in millions
of years which will be used to flag discrepancies
between occurrence FADs and LADs with respect to the
reference range. This is a convenience parameter so that
occurrences with large discrepancies can be quickly
identified. Multiple thresholds can be supplied</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical of length one determining if
the flagging progress should be reported to the console</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of two data.frames, the first recording
overall error statistics, the second recording error
types for each element of x. In the second data.frame,
FAD or LAD differences in excess of the supplied threshold(s)
are marked with 1, otherwise 0
</p>

<p>age_ranges is called internally to generate
the range table for comparison.

<pre><code class="language-R"># load the example datasets
