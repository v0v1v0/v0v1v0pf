<h2>Estimation of the risk for wind scab on fruit skin</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function estimates the risk of wind-induced abrasion injuries
(wind scab) on fruit skin during the sensitive periods of the 
species. This function estimates as risky the daily hours with 
'moderate breeze' wind (equal or above 5.5 m s-1 in the Beaufort 
scale) or stronger, estimated from a dataset with daily wind 
speeds.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wind_scab(climdata, fendata)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>climdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dataframe with daily wind speed data.
Required columns are Year, Month, Day, u2med. u2max is
optional.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fendata</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dataframe which can contain early fruit growth and
harvest dates. Start of initial growth (Start_ing) and end of initial growth
(End_ing) dates are used to assess for early wind-induced abrasion risk and
harvest dates (Harvest) are used for late (pre-harvest) abrasion risks.
Must contain the column Year, and can contain either Start_ing and End_ing
or Harvest columns, or the three of them.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Hourly wind speeds from daily values are computed using the 
formulas proposed by (Guo et al, 2016), using mean daily 
values (u2med, required) and maximum ones (u2max, optional). 
If only mean wind values are available, the function uses a
modified version of the Guo formula, so that the maximum 
values are obtained in daytime hours.
</p>
<p>Sensitive periods for wind scab in plums or nectarines
correspond to the early stages of fruit growth, usually the
first three weeks after full bloom (Michailides et al 1992, 
Michailides and Morgan 1992), mainly due to persistent leaf
brushing on fruit skin between the stages '8-mm fruit' and 
'20-mm fruit'. A second sensitive period for cherries, plums, 
peaches and nectarines is pre-harvest (30 days prior to that), 
due to persistent friction against branches. The function 
allows to set both periods or only one of them.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data frame with the columns Year, Day_s, Day_e, WA_efg (accumulated
hours with u2&gt;5.5 m s-1 on early fruit growth stage), Day_h, WA_bh
(accumulated hours with u2&gt;5.5 m s-1 on the month before harvest).
