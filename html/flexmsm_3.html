<h2>flexmsm: Flexible Multi-State Modelling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides a function for fitting any type of multistate survival model, with flexibly defined transition intensities and any type of observation scheme.
The package also provides a host of tools for straightforward interpretation and visualisation of the fitted model.
</p>
<p>The main fitting function is <code>fmsm</code>, which fits the multistate survival model, providing parameter and
as key inference quantities (p-values, estimated degrees of freedom, ...), as well as the elements needed to obtain
predicted transition intensities and probabilities, along with their confidence intervals.
</p>
<p>The main auxiliary functions are <code>Q.pred</code> and <code>P.pred</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Provides functions for fitting and interpreting the output of general flexible multistate survival models.
The process is defined by means of a list of model specifications for the transition intensities, each of which follow syntax
similar to that used for GAMs in <code>mgcv</code>.
</p>
<p>The estimation approach is based on a carefully structured, stable penalised likelihood approach, with the smoothers
(representing several types of covariate effects) set up using penalised regression splines.
The numerical routine carries out function minimization using a trust region algorithm in combination with an adaptation of an automatic
multiple smoothing parameter estimation procedure for Generalised Additive Models (see <code>mgcv</code> for more details on this last point). The smooths
supported by this package are those available in <code>mgcv</code>.
</p>
<p>Confidence intervals for smooth components and nonlinear functions of the model parameters are derived using a Bayesian approach.
P-values for testing individual smooth terms for equality to the zero function are also provided and based on the approach
implemented in <code>mgcv</code>. The usual plotting and summary functions are also available.
</p>
<p>Plots of the estimated transition intensities and transition probabilities can be obtained along with their respective confidence intervals.
This includes 3D plots when two-dimensional splines are included in the model specification of one or more transition intensities.
