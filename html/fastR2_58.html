<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In "Pass the Pigs", players roll two pig-shaped rubber dice and earn or lose
points depending on the configuration of the rolled pigs. Players compete
individually to earn 100 points.  On each turn, a player rolls he or she
decides to stop or until "pigging out" or
</p>
<p>The pig configurations and their associated scores are
</p>
<p>1 = Dot Up (0)
</p>
<p>2 = Dot Down (0)
</p>
<p>3 = Trotter (5)
</p>
<p>4 = Razorback (5)
</p>
<p>5 = Snouter (10)
</p>
<p>6 = Leaning Jowler (15)
</p>
<p>7 = Pigs are touching one another (-1; lose all points)
</p>
<p>One pig Dot Up and one Dot Down ends the turn (a "pig out") and results in 0
points for the turn.  If the pigs touch, the turn is ended and all points
for the game must be forfeited. Two pigs in the Dot Up or Dot Down
configuration score 1 point.  Otherwise, The scores of the two pigs in
different configurations are added together. The score is doubled if both
both pigs have the same configuration, so, for example, two Snouters are
worth 40 rather than 20.
