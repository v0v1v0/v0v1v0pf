<h2>A representation of a Quarto Website home webpage</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'quarto_website' object contain the data of the homepage for
a Quarto Website that was drawn in a Figma file. In other words, a
homepage was drawn in Figma, and then, it was imported to R trough the <code>figma</code>
package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">quarto_website
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>response</code>, produced by <code>httr</code> HTTP methods (e.g. <code>httr::GET()</code>);
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This Figma file contains a single page/canvas, and each HTML component
is a separate object in the Figma file. The name of each object in the
page/canvas correspond to the CSS selector used to style this HTML
component in a real Quarto Website.
</p>
<p>This is a interesting structure, because you can use the name and the attributes
of each object to build custom CSS code, that maybe matches the style of
a webpage.
</p>
<p>Is worth mentioning, that the <code>quarto_website</code> object
is a <code>httr::response</code> object
returned by <code>figma::get_figma_file()</code>. This <code>httr::response</code> object is
just a simple R list
with class <code>response</code>. The elements of this list and their description are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>url</code>: The URL used in the HTTP request made to the Figma API;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>status_code</code>: The HTTP status code returned by the Figma API;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>headers</code> and <code>all_headers</code>: The list of headers returned by the Figma API;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>cookies</code>: A named list of cookies returned by the Figma API;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>content</code>: The body of the response, as raw vector. See <code>httr::content()</code> for various ways to parse this content;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>date</code> and <code>times</code>: Timing information about the HTTP request made to the Figma API;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>handle</code>: The handle associated with the url;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>request</code>: The URL, HTTP method and options used in the HTTP request made to the Figma API;
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All data of the Figma file is stored in the <code>content</code> element. However, this data is in raw
format (i.e. in raw bytes). To convert these raw bytes into a useful format like a R list, or a
string, you should use the <code>httr::content()</code> function. See <code>vignette("figma")</code> for a
detailed description of the data present in this <code>content</code> element;
