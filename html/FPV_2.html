Testing Hypotheses via Fuzzy P-Value in Fuzzy Environment
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Statistical testing hypotheses has an important rule for making decision in practical and applied problems. In traditional testing methods, data, parameters, hypotheses and other elements of problem are considered crisp. 
But in applied sciences such as economics, agriculture and social sciences, it may be confront with vague definitions and fuzzy concepts. In such situations, the classical methods can not solve the vague test and they need to generalize for using in fuzzy environments. 
The vagueness entrance in testing hypotheses problem can be done via data or/and hypotheses. Therefore, the following three major problems can be usually considered for a fuzzy environment: 
(1) testing crisp hypotheses based on fuzzy data, 
(2) testing fuzzy hypotheses based on crisp data, and 
(3) testing fuzzy hypotheses based on fuzzy data.
Similar to the classical testing hypotheses, one can consider different procedure methods for solving the above mentioned problems such as Neyman-Pearson, Bayes, likelihood ratio, minimax and p-value. Computing Fuzzy p-Value package, i.e. <code>Fuzzy.p.value</code> package, is an open source (LGPL 3) package for R which investigate on the above three problems on the basis of fuzzy p-value approach. 
All formulas and given examples are match with (Parchami and Mashinchi, 2016) to easily show the performance of the proposed methods.
