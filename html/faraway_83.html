<h2>Third party motor insurance claims in Sweden in 1977</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In Sweden all motor insurance companies apply identical risk arguments to
classify customers, and thus their portfolios and their claims statistics
can be combined. The data were compiled by a Swedish Committee on the
Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance. The Committee was asked to look
into the problem of analyzing the real influence on claims of the risk
arguments and to compare this structure with the actual tariff.
