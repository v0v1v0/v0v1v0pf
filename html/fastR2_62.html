<h2>American football punting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Investigators studied physical characteristics and ability in 13 football
punters. Each volunteer punted a football ten times. The investigators
recorded the average distance for the ten punts, in feet. They also recorded
the average hang time (time the ball is in the air before the receiver
catches it), and a number of measures of leg strength and flexibility.
</p>
