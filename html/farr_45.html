<h2>Data on firm headquarters based on SEC EDGAR filings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on firm headquarters based on SEC EDGAR filings.
Dates related to SEC filing dates. Rather than provide dates for
all filings, data are aggregated into groups of filings by state and
CIK and dates are collapsed into windows over which
all filings for a given CIK were associated with a given state.
For example, CIK 0000037755 has filings with a CA headquarters from
1994-06-02 until 1996-03-25, then filings with an OH headquarters from
1996-05-30 until 1999-04-05, then filings with a CA headquarters from
1999-06-11 onwards.
To ensure continuous coverage over the sample period, it is assumed that
any change in state occurs the day after the last observed filing for
the previous state.
