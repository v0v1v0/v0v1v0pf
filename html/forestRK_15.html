<h2>
Extract the list of covariates used to perform the splits to
generate a particular tree(s) in a <code>forestRK</code> object
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Spits out the list of covariates used to perform the splits to generate
a particular tree(s) in a <code>forestRK</code> object that the user provided.
</p>
<p>The function extracts the list of names of covariates used in splits to
construct a single or a multiple numbers of trees from a <code>forestRK</code>
object. The <code>var.used.forestRK</code> displays the actual name of the covariate
used for each split (not their numericized ones), consistent to the exact
order of the split; for instance, the 1st element of the vector
<code>covariate.used.for.split.tree[["6"]]</code> from the example below is the
covariate on which the 1st split had occured while the 6th tree in the
<code>forestRK.1</code> object was built.
</p>
<p>Each vector in the list are named by the exact indices of the tree;
for example, if the code
<code>obj &lt;- var.used.forestRK(forestRK.1, tree.index=c(4,5,6))</code> is used to
extract the list of covariates used for splitting to construct 4th, 5th, and
6th trees in the forest, and the user can retrieve the information pertains
explicitly to the 6th tree in the forest by doing <code>obj[["6"]]</code>.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of vectors that stores the names of covariates on which each split was
performed to construct the specific tree(s) in a <code>forestRK</code> model that the
user provided.
