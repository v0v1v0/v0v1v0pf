<h2>
capture frequecies
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Real capture frequencies will be fitted to a geometric, a truncated geometic, a Poisson, and a negative binomial distribution. 
These distributions provide the basis for estimating population sizes, their standard error, and symmetric as well as asymmetric confidence intervalls. 
Moreover, expected values for these four distributions will be calculated allowing comparisons betweens real and expected capture frequecies.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">freq(fi)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fi</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector of capture frequencies with length of all (successive) sampling periods; start the vector using c()
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>All meassured and expected values: </code></td>
<td>
<p>All measured an expected values of actual and possible distributions</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>All estimated values: </code></td>
<td>
<p>All estimted values including number of individuals captured, distribution parameters, population size and respective standard error, symmetric and asymmetric 95 percent confidence interval</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>unused argument â€“&gt; fi must be a vector starting c(a,b,c,..)</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># In your field population, 53 individuals were captured once, 19 were captured twice, 
# 4 were captured three times, 1 was captured four times 
# and no individual was captured five or six times. 
# As there were six capture occasions, the fifth and sixth capture occasion is set to 0.
# call your capture frequencies as follows:
freq(c(53,19,4,1,0,0))
