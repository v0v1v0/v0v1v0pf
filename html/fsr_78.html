<h2>Visitation: An example of FSI model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>visitation()</code> provides an example, without rules, of a fuzzy spatial inference (FSI) model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">visitation()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>visitation()</code> function provides a hypothetical FSI model that estimates the visiting experience based on prices and overall ratings of accommodations as well as sanitary conditions of restaurants.
The output of such a model infers a value between 0 and 100 that indicates how attractive it is to visit a specific location.
For this, the experience can be classified as <em>awful</em>, <em>average</em>, and <em>great</em>.
</p>
<p>The linguistic variables and their linguistic values of this FSI model are listed below:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>accommodation price</em> with <em>cut-rate</em>, <em>affordable</em>, and <em>expensive</em> as linguistic values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>accommodation review</em> with <em>bad</em>, <em>good</em>, and <em>excellent</em> as linguistic values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>food safety</em> with <em>low</em>, <em>medium</em>, and <em>high</em> as linguistic values, which represent levels of sanitary conditions.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is just a small running example, containing a small set of points to represent the locations of accommodations and restaurants.
</p>
<p>The usage of FSI models is subdivided into a <em>preparation phase</em> and an <em>evaluation phase</em>.
The preparation phase is responsible for instantiating a new FSI model with the elements of the data source component of FIFUS.
For this, the <code>fsr</code> package provides the following functions: <code>fsi_create()</code>, <code>fsi_add_fsa()</code>, and <code>fsi_add_cs()</code>.
These functions are employed by <code>visitation()</code> so that users can add their own fuzzy set rules (by using <code>fsi_add_rules()</code>) and perform the evaluation phase (by using the functions <code>fsi_eval()</code> and/or <code>fsi_qw_eval()</code>).
</p>
<p>In this sense, <code>visitation()</code> performs the following internal actions to return an FSI model:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> specify the linguistic variables and their corresponding linguistic values, which are in turn represented by membership functions. These items are specified according to the context of the running example.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> define small point datasets that represent each linguistic variable. Such datasets are <code>tibble</code> objects.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> build spatial plateau objects by using <code>spa_creator()</code> on the datasets. As a result, we get spatial plateau objects that represent each linguistic value.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> create an FSI model with <code>fsi_create()</code> function.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> add fuzzy spatial antecedents with <code>fsi_add_fsa()</code>. Recall that the antecedents are spatial plateau objects previously built.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> define the linguistic variable and its linguistic values with membership functions for the consequent.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> add the consequent to the FSI model by using <code>fsi_add_cs()</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An FSI model without fuzzy rules set.
