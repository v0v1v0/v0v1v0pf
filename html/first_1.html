<h2>Factor Importance Ranking and Selection using Total (Sobol') indices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>first</code> implements the <em><strong>model-independent</strong></em> factor importance and selection procedure proposed in Huang and Joseph (2024).
The importance measure is based on total Sobol' indices from global sensitivity analysis.
Factor importance computation and selection are performed directly from the noisy data.
Parallel computations are available to accelerate the estimation.
For categorical data inputs, please convert them to factor type before calling the function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">first(
  X,
  y,
  n.knn = NULL,
  n.mc = nrow(X),
  twin.mc = FALSE,
  rescale = TRUE,
  n.forward = 2,
  parl = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>first</code> provides factor importance ranking and selection directly from scattered data without any model fitting.
Factor importance is computed based on total Sobol' indices (Sobol', 2001),
which is connected to the approximation error introduced by excluding the factor of interest (Huang and Joseph, 2024).
The estimation procedure adapts from the Nearest-Neighbor estimator in Broto et al. (2020) to account for the noisy data.
Integrating it with forward selection and backward elimination allows for factor selection.
</p>
<p><code>first</code> belongs to the class of forward-backward selection with early dropping algorithm (Borboudakis and Tsamardinos, 2019).
In forward selection, each time we find the candidate that maximizes the output variance that can be explained.
For candidates that cannot improve the variance explained conditional on the selected factors, they are removed from the candidate set.
This forward selection step is run <code>n_forward</code> times to tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. <code>n_forward=2</code> is recommended in Yu et al. (2020).
To run the complete forward selection, please set <code>n_forward</code> to the number of factors / predictors.
In backward elimination, we again remove one factor at a time, starting with the factor that can improve the explained variance most, till no factor can further improve.
</p>
<p><code>n.knn=2</code> nearest-neighbors is recommended for integer/numeric output, and <code>n.knn=3</code> is suggested for binary output.
For numeric inputs, it is recommended to standardize them via setting the argument <code>rescale=TRUE</code>.
Categorical inputs are transformed via one-hot encoding for the nearest-neighbor search.
To speed up the nearest-neighbor search, k-d tree from the <span class="pkg">FNN</span> package is used.
Also, parallel computation is also supported via the <span class="pkg">parallel</span> package.
</p>
<p>For large datasets, we support the use of subsamples for further acceleration.
Use argument <code>n.mc</code> to specify the number of subsamples.
Two options are available for finding the subsamples: random and twinning (Vakayil and Joseph, 2022).
Twinning is able to find subsamples that better represent the big data, i.e.,
providing a more accurate estimation, but at a slightly higher computational cost.
For more details, please see the <span class="pkg">twinning</span> package.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector of the factor importance, with zero indicating that the factor is not important to the prediction of the response.
