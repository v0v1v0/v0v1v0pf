<h2>Creates panel or cross-classified data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows the user to create data structures that are paneled or
cross-classified: where one level of observation draws simultaneously from
two or many source levels. Common examples of panels include country-year
data which have country-level and year-level characteristics.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cross_levels(by = NULL, ...)

link_levels(N = NULL, by = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>The result of a call to <code>join_using()</code> which specifies how
the cross-classified data will be created</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>A variable or series of variables to add to the resulting data
frame after the cross-classified data is created.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of observations in the resulting data frame.
If <code>N</code> is NULL or not provided, the join_using will be an "outer product" â€“
merging each row of each provided data frame with each other data frame to
make a full panel.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>By specifying the appropriate arguments in <code>join_using()</code> within the
function call, it is possible to induce correlation in cross-classified data.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data.frame
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Generate full panel data
panel &lt;- fabricate(
 countries = add_level(N = 20, country_shock = runif(N, 1, 10)),
 years = add_level(N = 20, year_shock = runif(N, 1, 10), nest=FALSE),
 obs = cross_levels(by = join_using(countries, years), GDP_it = country_shock + year_shock)
)

# Include an "N" argument to allow for cross-classified
# data.
students &lt;- fabricate(
 primary_school = add_level(N = 20, ps_quality = runif(N, 1, 10)),
 secondary_school = add_level(N = 15, ss_quality = runif(N, 1, 10), nest=FALSE),
 students = link_levels(N = 500, by = join_using(primary_school, secondary_school))
)

# Induce a correlation structure in cross-classified data by providing
# rho.

 secondary_school = add_level(N = 15, ss_quality = runif(N, 1, 10), nest=FALSE),
