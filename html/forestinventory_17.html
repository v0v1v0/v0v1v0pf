<h2>Data from a multiphase forest inventory at the zurichberg (zurich), switzerland</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset from 1991 containing 1203 sample plots observations from a forest inventory using cluster-sampling.
The large phase comprises 298 clusters. Terrestrial information of the stem number as well as the basal area
is available for a systematic subsample of 73 clusters. Auxiliary information at all 2103 sample plots were
derived by stand maps. Originally the inventory was carried out as a twophase inventory and
has been artificially extended to a threephase inventory for demonstration purposes.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">zberg
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>data frame with 1203 rows and 12 columns
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p><code>cluster</code>     cluster identification. Maximum number of sample plots per cluster is 5.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>phase_id_2p</code> phase-membership of each observation for the twophase inventory.
The first phase is indicated by <code>1</code>, the second (i.e. terrestrial) phase by <code>2</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>phase_id_3p</code> the phase-membership of each observation for the threephase inventory,
i.e. the first phase (<code>0</code>), the second phase (<code>1</code>)
and third (terrestrial) phase (<code>2</code>). <em>Note:</em> The threephase sample scheme
was artificially created for demonstration purposes of the
<code>threephase</code>-functions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>stade</code>       development stage at sample plot location based on the stand map.
Categorical variable of class <code>factor</code> with 4 <code>levels</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>melange</code>     degree of mixture at sample plot location based on the stand map.
Categorical variable of class <code>factor</code> with 2 <code>levels</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>couver</code>      crown-coverage at sample plot location based on the stand map.
Categorical variable of class <code>factor</code> with 2 <code>levels</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>stem</code>        stem number derived at field survey.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>basal</code>       basal area derived at field survey.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ismallg23</code>   indicator for small area 2 and 3 for each observation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
