<h2>British Train Accidents.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are obtained from Atkinson and Riani (2000), which is a simplified version of the data in Evans (2000). The outcome is the number of deaths that occurred in a train accident with a categorical covariate describing the type of rolling stock, and an exposure variable giving the annual distance travelled by trains in that year, and was originally analysed using a Poisson model.  As the data does not include observations with zero deaths, it will be analysed here as a zero-truncated Poisson with an offset of log of the train distance. The <code>derailme</code> data frame has 67 rows and 5 columns.
