<h2>Political Elasticity Scores</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This folder contains the data behind the story 'Election Update: The House Districts That Swing The Most (And Least) With The National Mood'
<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-house-districts-that-swing-the-most-and-least-with-the-national-mood/</a>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">elasticity_by_district
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataset with 435 rows representing congressional districts and 2 variables
</p>

<dl>
<dt>district</dt>
<dd>
<p>congressional district</p>
</dd>
<dt>pvi_538</dt>
<dd>
<p>pvi</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The original dataset only has 2 columns: "district" and "elasticity". I separated  the "district" columns into two.
For example, in row 1 of the dataset, the original "district" = "MI-5", and I separated it into â€œstate" = "Michigan" and "district_number" = "5".
In addition, I used the full names for all states instead of abbreviations.
