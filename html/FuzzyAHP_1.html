<h2>Package for calculation of classic and Fuzzy AHP</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">FuzzyAHP</span> is an open source (LGPL 3) package for R.
The package is only suitable for AHP that uses categorical rating of criteria
for alternatives instead of pairwise comparison of alternatives according to
each criteria. This adaptation of AHP is common in situations when the number
of alternatives is hight and the pairwise comparison is thus inadequate or
impossible to construct. The weights for criteria are, however, still determined
from the pairwise comparison matrix. This approach towards AHP is common in
Geosciences as well as other fields.
</p>
<p>The determination of criteria weights is done according to process described
by Krejčí, Pavlačka, and Talašová (2016), which yelds significantly narrower
fuzzy numbers than previously used approaches.
