<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The WCGS began in 1960 with 3,524 male volunteers who were employed by 11
California companies. Subjects were 39 to 59 years old and free of heart
disease as determined by electrocardiogram. After the initial screening, the
study population dropped to 3,154 and the number of companies to 10 because
of various exclusions. The cohort comprised both blue- and white-collar
employees. At baseline the following information was collected:
socio-demographic including age, education, marital status, income,
occupation; physical and physiological including height, weight, blood
pressure, electrocardiogram, and corneal arcus; biochemical including
cholesterol and lipoprotein fractions; medical and family history and use of
medications; behavioral data including Type A interview, smoking, exercise,
and alcohol use. Later surveys added data on anthropometry, triglycerides,
Jenkins Activity Survey, and caffeine use. Average follow-up continued for
8.5 years with repeat examinations
