<h2>DROPS data sets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These datasets come from the European Union project DROPS (DROught-tolerant
yielding PlantS). A panel of 256 maize hybrids was grown with two water
regimes (irrigated or rainfed), in seven fields in 2012 and 2013,
respectively, spread along a climatic transect from western to eastern
Europe, plus one site in Chile in 2013. This resulted in 28 experiments
defined as the combination of one year, one site and one water regime, with
two and three repetitions for rainfed and irrigated treatments, respectively.
A detailed environmental characterisation was carried out, with hourly
records of micrometeorological data and soil water status, and associated
with precise measurement of phenology. Grain yield and its components were
measured at the end of the experiment.<br>
The data sets contain the genotypic BLUEs for eight traits for 246 genotypes
in 37 environments. Additionally information on 11 environmental indices
is included. The environments are split in three data sets for training
(<code>drops_GE</code>) and testing (<code>drops_GnE</code>, <code>drops_nGnE</code>)
purposes. <code>drops_K</code> contains the kinship matrix for the 246 genotypes.
